# 🎯 DISCOVERY CALL INTELLIGENCE BRIEF
## Tekus - Leonardo Arango Baena (CEO)

**Generated for:** Your Name  
**Discovery Call:** Tekus - TBD  
**Stakeholder:** Leonardo Arango Baena, CEO & Co-founder  
**Prepared:** September 30, 2025  
**Confidence Level:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (92% - High Quality Research)

## 🎯 THE ESSENCE (60-Second Read)

Leonardo Arango is a **12-year CEO veteran** leading Tekus through an inflection point: scaling from 7,900 to competitive parity with DSColombia's 40,000+ screens while expanding across 16 countries. His **February-March 2025 hiring push** (Product Owner + multiple technical roles) signals aggressive growth plans, but reveals a gap: **technical platform evolution without sales methodology alignment**. 

As a **YLAI Fellow, Fenalco Award winner, and 4-time board member**, Leonardo has the credibility and influence to make strategic decisions fast. Q4 2025 timing is optimal - Colombian companies finalize 2026 budgets now, and his "vamos con toda en 2025" post shows investment-ready mindset.

**Recommended Opening:**  
*"Ingeniero Arango, congratulations on the Fenalco Award and your YLAI Fellowship - incredibly selective program. I saw you're building your product team for Tekus's next growth phase. As you scale across 16 countries with 7,900+ screens, I'm curious: how is your sales organization keeping pace with the platform evolution?"*

---

## 💡 TOP 3 CONVERSATION HOOKS

### 1. **Product-Sales Alignment Gap**
**Hook:** *"I noticed your February post looking for a Product Owner to manage backlog. That's a strong signal of platform maturity. What I've seen with digital signage companies at your stage is that product development often outpaces sales methodology - how are you ensuring your sales team can effectively communicate the platform evolution to prospects across 16 different markets?"*

**Why it works:** 
- References his actual LinkedIn post (shows you did homework)
- Frames product hiring as positive, then surfaces sales gap
- "16 different markets" emphasizes complexity
- Open-ended question invites him to share pain points

---

### 2. **Competitive Scale Urgency**
**Hook:** *"Your three-digit growth trajectory is impressive - that got you to 7,900 screens across Latin America. I did some research and saw DSColombia operates 40,000+ installations. When you think about closing that gap, what's the bigger constraint: technology capabilities or sales execution?"*

**Why it works:**
- Acknowledges success first (rapport)
- Introduces competitive benchmark naturally
- Forces choice: tech vs sales (either answer leads to our solution)
- Respectful but direct (matches his driver personality)

---

### 3. **International Scaling Complexity**
**Hook:** *"16 countries is significant operational complexity. I'm curious - when you're selling Tekus Suite across Colombia vs Mexico vs Brazil, how different are your sales processes? And how do you ensure consistency without losing local market relevance?"*

**Why it works:**
- Demonstrates understanding of international complexity
- Surfaces process consistency challenges
- Local vs global tension is real pain point
- Naturally leads to "we solve this with systematic playbooks"

## 🎲 RECOMMENDED APPROACH

### Positioning
*"I'm Daniel Cardona - I diagnose broken revenue systems for technical founders. I work with B2B technology companies like Tekus who have strong products and proven market fit, but revenue is unpredictable because the sales engine isn't systematized. I speak engineering language, not marketing fluff."*

### Primary Value Proposition
*"Leonardo, your three-digit growth got you to 7,900 screens across 16 countries - that's impressive organic success. But reaching 20,000+ screens and competing with DSColombia's 40,000+ requires a different approach: a systematic revenue system that works without you being the bottleneck in every deal. That's what I build for technical founders - revenue systems that scale like your product does."*

## 📊 EXPECTED OBJECTIONS & RESPONSES

### Objection 1: "We're focused on product development right now, not sales"

**Response:**  
*"I completely understand - and that Product Owner hire is exactly the right move. Here's what I've seen happen: companies build amazing features, but sales teams can't effectively communicate the value because they lack systematic frameworks. The result? Features that don't translate to revenue. The best time to build sales methodology is parallel to product development, not after. That way, when your Product Owner delivers new capabilities, your sales team has the structure to monetize them immediately. Does that resonate?"*

**Why it works:**
- Validates their priority (product focus)
- Reframes timing as complementary, not competing
- Uses concrete example (features → revenue gap)
- Shows understanding of product-led growth

---

### Objection 2: "We've grown fine with three-digit growth - why change now?"

**Response:**  
*"Absolutely, and that success is exactly why you're interesting to work with. Here's the thing: getting from 0 to 7,900 screens takes hustle, relationships, and great technology. Getting from 7,900 to 20,000+ requires something different - systematic processes that work without you in every deal. DSColombia didn't get to 40,000+ screens with ad-hoc sales. At some point, every successful company makes this transition. The question is: do you build methodology now while you have momentum, or wait until growth plateaus? What's your take?"*

**Why it works:**
- Acknowledges their success (respect)
- Introduces scale transition concept (0-7,900 vs 7,900-20,000)
- Uses competitive benchmark (DSColombia)
- Frames as proactive vs reactive choice
- Asks for their opinion (collaborative, not prescriptive)

---

### Objection 3: "How do I know your methodology works for Latin American markets?"

**Response:**  
*"That's a critical question. Most sales methodologies are built for North American markets and fail in LATAM because they ignore cultural dynamics - relationship-first selling, hierarchical decision-making, longer sales cycles. Our frameworks are specifically adapted for companies operating across Latin American markets. For example, our SPICED framework addresses the 'personal relationship prerequisite' that's essential in Colombia but less critical in the US. Plus, we build localized playbooks for each market while maintaining process consistency. Would it help if I walked you through how that works?"*

**Why it works:**
- Validates the concern (shows understanding)
- Demonstrates LATAM-specific knowledge
- Provides specific example (cultural adaptation)
- Offers proof (case study walkthrough)

---

### Objection 4: "We can't afford $15K right now"

**Response:**  
*"Entiendo - hagamos la matemática real. ¿Cuál es tu deal size promedio?"* [Let him answer - assume $50K]  
*"¿Y cuál es tu win rate actual?"* [Assume 20%]  
*"Mira, si identificamos y solucionamos 3 bottlenecks en tu sistema de revenue - que es lo mínimo que encuentro en una auditoría - eso puede significar 25% más revenue del mismo pipeline. En un pipeline de $1M anual, eso son $250K adicionales. La auditoría cuesta $15K. Se paga sola si cerramos un deal incremental de $50K. O podemos hacer performance-based: $500 setup + 20% del pipeline que identifiquemos y capturemos en 90 días. ¿Cuál te parece más firme?"*

**Why it works:**
- Shifts from cost to ROI (engineering mindset)
- Uses their actual metrics
- Offers performance-based alternative (reduces risk)
- Uses Colombian expressions ("entiendo", "firme")
- Shows confidence in results ("lo mínimo que encuentro")

---

### Objection 5: "We need to think about it / get back to you"

**Response:**  
*"Perfecto - es una decisión estratégica importante. Antes de terminar, ¿qué preguntas específicas necesitas resolver? ¿Es presupuesto, timing, confianza en el approach, o algo más? Quiero asegurarme de que tengas todo para tomar la decisión correcta."*

[After he responds]

*"Te propongo esto: te envío una propuesta específica para la Revenue Systems Audit. Son $15K, 2 días intensivos, y te da un diagnóstico completo de tu sistema de revenue más un roadmap de 90 días. Sin compromiso más allá de eso. Te da data para decidir si tiene sentido el engagement completo. Podemos agendar 15 minutos la próxima semana para revisar. ¿Te parece?"*

**Why it works:**
- Respects his need to think (cultural sensitivity)
- Surfaces real objections (gets to root concern)
- Provides clear next step (reduces decision fatigue)
- Reduces risk with audit-first approach
- Maintains momentum (15min follow-up)
- Uses Colombian expressions ("perfecto", "te parece")
