# MINI INTELLIGENCE BRIEF - TEKUS

**Company:** Tekus (Digital Signage & MarTech)  
**Contact:** Leonardo Arango Baena (CEO & Co-founder)  
**Call Date:** TBD  
**Prepared:** September 30, 2025

---

## The Essence (1 sentence):

Tekus is a Colombian digital signage leader scaling across 16 countries with 7,900+ screens, actively hiring Product Owners and technical talent in Q4 2025, creating a perfect window to position platform modernization and sales methodology support as they compete against larger players like DSColombia's 40,000+ installations.

---

## Top 3 Conversation Hooks:

1. **"Congratulations on your YLAI Fellowship and the Fenalco Award - I saw you're actively building your product team. As you scale Tekus across 16 countries, what's your biggest platform modernization challenge right now?"**
   - Opens with recognition, surfaces current priorities

2. **"Your three-digit growth trajectory is impressive. I noticed DSColombia has 40,000+ installations vs your 7,900 screens - what technology or sales capabilities would help you close that gap faster?"**
   - Addresses competitive pressure, surfaces sales challenges

3. **"I saw your February post looking for a Product Owner for backlog management. How is your sales team keeping pace with this technical platform evolution?"**
   - Connects product development to sales enablement needs

---

## Primary Pain Point:

**Sales team scaling challenges while managing international expansion** - Operating across 16 countries with aggressive growth plans ("vamos con toda en 2025") but facing competitive pressure from larger players. Active hiring signals need for systematized sales processes to support platform growth and technical team expansion.

**Evidence:**
- Hiring Product Owner + multiple technical roles (Feb-Mar 2025)
- 7,900 screens vs competitors with 40,000+ (scale gap)
- 16-country operations require consistent sales execution
- CEO has 12+ years tenure but no sales methodology indicators

---

## Recommended Wave Entry:

☑️ **Wave 1: Foundation Assessment** 

**Why:** 
- New product development phase = perfect timing for sales process alignment
- International operations (16 countries) need standardized sales methodology
- Competitive pressure requires systematic approach to close scale gap
- Strong growth momentum + hiring budget = investment-ready mindset

**Expansion Path:** Wave 1 → Wave 2 (Sales Playbook for international consistency) → Wave 3 (Team Coaching for scaling sales team)

---

## Expected Objections:

1. **"We're focused on product development right now, not sales processes"**
   - Response: "That's exactly why now is the perfect time. Your Product Owner will build features, but without a systematic sales approach across 16 countries, those features won't translate to market share gains against DSColombia's established network."

2. **"We've grown fine so far with three-digit growth - why change?"**
   - Response: "Absolutely, and that growth got you to 7,900 screens. But to compete at DSColombia's 40,000+ scale, you need systematic processes. The companies that scale successfully build methodology before they hit the wall."

## Estimated Deal Size: **$28,000 - $32,000**

**Breakdown:**
- Wave 1 (Foundation): $7,000
- Wave 2 (Sales Playbook - International): $10,000
- Wave 3 (Team Coaching): $8,000
- Total Package: $25,000-$35,000 range

---

## Urgency Level: 🔥🔥🔥🔥 (4/5)

**Why High Urgency:**
- Q4 2025 budget planning cycle (Colombian companies finalize 2026 budgets in Oct-Nov)
- Active hiring momentum = budget available + growth mindset
- Competitive pressure from DSColombia
- Product team expansion needs sales alignment
- Leonardo in first-year board positions (wants quick wins to demonstrate leadership)

---

## Red Flags (if any):

⚠️ **Minor Risk:** No recent funding announcements detected - may be bootstrapped growth which could impact budget flexibility
- **Mitigation:** Position as investment in revenue growth (ROI-focused), offer phased implementation

✅ **Positive Signals:**
- CEO 12+ years tenure (stability)
- No negative press or churn signals
- Award recognition (Fenalco, YLAI)
- Sustained "three-digit growth"
- Active hiring = healthy cash flow
