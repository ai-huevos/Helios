## CASH FLOW PROJECTION (Year 1)

### Base Case Scenario

| Quarter | Income | Expenses | Net | Cumulative |
|---------|--------|----------|-----|------------|
| Q1 | $47,000 | $56,250 | -$9,250 | -$9,250 |
| Q2 | $52,000 | $56,250 | -$4,250 | -$13,500 |

### Cash Runway Analysis

```
If we raise $200K:
├── Year 1 expenses: ~$225K (Scenario B)
├── Year 1 income:   ~$218K (Base case)
├── Net Year 1:      -$7K
├── Buffer remaining: $200K - $7K = $193K
└── Runway: 24+ months (comfortable)

If we raise $150K:
├── Year 1 expenses: ~$201K (Scenario A)
├── Year 1 income:   ~$164K (Conservative)
├── Net Year 1:      -$37K
├── Buffer remaining: $150K - $37K = $113K
└── Runway: 18 months (tight but viable)

Breakeven point: ~$19K/month revenue
Current run rate: ~$18K/month (from confirmed contracts)
Gap to close: ~$1K/month recurring = 50-100 users on Director AI

|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Founder-originated deal | 10% of contract value | 0% |

| Referral from client | 7.5% split | 0% |

*Commission paid after client payment received, not on contract signature*

---

## EQUITY SPLIT OPTIONS

### The Principle
Higher salary = lower equity. Both founders should feel fairly compensated for risk taken.

### Current Salary Differential
- Cardona: $6,000/month ($72K/year)
- Restrepo: $8,250/month ($99K/year)
- **Difference:** $2,250/month = $27K/year

### Option A: Equal Equity, Acknowledge Salary Gap
| Founder | Salary | Equity | Rationale |
|---------|--------|--------|-----------|
| Cardona | $6,000 | 50% | Lower salary = higher risk taken |
| Restrepo | $8,250 | 50% | Higher salary compensates for lower risk |

*Simple, clean. Restrepo's higher salary is his "risk premium."*

### Option B: Proportional Adjustment
| Founder | Salary | Equity | Rationale |
|---------|--------|--------|-----------|
| Cardona | $6,000 | 52-53% | Originated business, lower salary |
| Restrepo | $8,250 | 47-48% | Joined later, higher salary |

*Math: $27K/year gap over 4 years = ~$108K. At $1.6M valuation, 108K/$1.6M = ~7% equity value. Split the difference = 3.5% adjustment.*

### Option C: Same Equity, Cliff Vesting for Higher Salary
| Founder | Salary | Equity | Vesting |
|---------|--------|--------|---------|
| Cardona | $6,000 | 50% | Standard 4-year, 1-year cliff |
| Restrepo | $8,250 | 50% | 4-year, 18-month cliff |

*Both get same equity, but Restrepo's longer cliff reflects salary premium.*

### Recommendation
**Option A** is cleanest for investor conversations. The salary difference is small enough ($27K/year) that it doesn't warrant complex equity math. Keep it simple: 50/50 co-founders, Restrepo's higher salary is acknowledged and accepted.
