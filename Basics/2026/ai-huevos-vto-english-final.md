# PART 1: WHO WE ARE

## Founding Team

| Role | Person | Monthly (USD) | Equity | Brings |
|------|--------|---------------|--------|--------|
| **Co-Founder (Vision/Sales)** | Daniel Cardona | $6,000 | 50% | 3 years at Finkargo, growth/marketing/revenue systems, 110+ processes automated, sees systems where others see chaos |
| **Co-Founder (Product/Delivery)** | Daniel Restrepo | $8,250 | 50% | 3 years at Finkargo, operations/product/process architecture, built systems handling $650M in transactions, makes things actually work |

**Total Founder Cost:** $14,250/month | $171,000/year

**Equity Principle:** Higher salary = compensation for taking less financial risk. Both founders committed equally; salary difference is acknowledged and accepted.

---

## Core Values

### 1. WONDER EYES
**We search for truth through curiosity.**

We don't accept "that's how we've always done it." We ask why until we understand. We dig into organizations like archaeologists—not to judge, but to discover what's really happening beneath the surface.

*Test: Did we ask enough questions before proposing a solution?*

---

### 2. WE BUILD COOL SHIT
**We only ship work we're proud of.**

If we wouldn't use it ourselves, we don't deliver it. We'd rather say no to a project than deliver something mediocre. Our reputation is built one deliverable at a time.

*Test: Would we show this to our smartest friend without embarrassment?*

---

### 3. DESIGN IS USEFUL
**Good design works. Pretty is a side effect.**

We don't make things look good—we make things work well. When something works perfectly, it usually looks good too. We optimize for function, then refine for form.

*Test: Does this solve the problem, or does it just look like it does?*

---

### 4. NO BULLSHIT
**We communicate clearly. The first time.**

No jargon. No hiding behind complexity. If we can't explain it simply, we don't understand it well enough. We respect people's time by being direct.

*Test: Would a smart 15-year-old understand what we just said?*

---

### 5. OUTCOMES OVER ACTIVITY
**We measure results, not hours.**

We don't care how long something takes—we care what it produces. Reduced headcount. Faster processes. More revenue. Lower costs. If we can't measure the impact, we didn't create value.

*Test: Can we put a number on what we delivered?*

---

# PART 2: WHAT WE DO

## The Problem We Solve

### Every big company runs on three invisible systems:
1. **WhatsApp** – where the real decisions happen
2. **Excel** – where the real data lives
3. **People's heads** – where the real knowledge is trapped

You've spent millions on SAP, Oracle, fancy software. Your people use maybe 20% of it.

Meanwhile:
- Your best employee quits → chaos
- You need a report → 3 days of Excel work
- You want to know what's really happening → nobody can tell you

**Everyone's talking about AI. Nobody's talking about the fact that AI can't help if your company's reality lives in WhatsApp groups and Excel files.**

**They need someone who will interview everyone, find what's broken, fix it with technology, and stay to keep improving.**

---

## Our Solution

### We build rails.

Think about railroads. Before trains, every town was an island. Rails connected them.

Your company is the same:
- SAP is one island
- Excel is another
- WhatsApp is another
- Each department is another

**We build the rails so information can flow. So AI can actually work. So you can see what's happening.**

### How It Works (Simple, Linear)

| Step | What Happens | Time |
|------|--------------|------|
| **1. We talk** | Interview your team. Find what's broken. | 2-4 weeks |
| **2. We fix** | Build automations that do the boring work. | 2-8 weeks |
| **3. We improve** | Your people give feedback. We make it smarter. | Ongoing |
| **4. We stay** | Director AI keeps everything connected. | Monthly |

### Three Products

**1. The Checkup ($5-15K)**
Like going to the doctor. We interview everyone, look at all your systems, and give you a complete picture.

**You get:**
- Map of who does what (the real one, not the org chart)
- List of systems and how much they're actually used
- Where money is being wasted
- Priority list: what to fix first

**2. The Fix ($15-50K per automation)**
We build tools that do the boring work.

**You get:**
- Working automation in 2-3 weeks
- Your people give feedback, we improve it
- Every automation gets smarter over time

**3. Director AI ($10-20/user/month)**
Your company's brain. Everything in one place.

**You get:**
- All company knowledge accessible
- Ask questions, get real answers
- See problems before they become crises
- New employees learn 10x faster

## What We Actually Deliver

**We only get paid for outcomes. These are the only four that matter:**

| Outcome | How We Measure | Example |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| **Reduce Headcount** | FTEs eliminated or redeployed | 4 conciliation roles → 0 = $48K/year saved |
| **Optimize Process** | Hours saved per week/month | Contract generation: 4 hours → 15 minutes |
| **Increase Revenue** | $ directly attributed | Call center automation → 20% more bookings |
| **Reduce Costs** | CAC, COGS, or overhead reduction | Lead qualification → 30% lower CAC |

**If we can't tie our work to one of these four outcomes, we don't do the project.**

---

# PART 3: WHY WE WIN

## Value Proposition (One Sentence) 

> **We interview your people, find what's broken, fix it with technology, and stay to keep improving.**

Think of us like hiring a new operations director—but one who actually talks to everyone, finds the real problems, and fixes them. Not with more meetings. With technology that works.

---

## Why Us? (3 Uniques)

### 1. Organizational Archaeology
We don't trust org charts. We interview everyone—68 interviews, 2,748 entities extracted, 292 automation opportunities identified in our first engagement. We see what's actually happening, not what the CEO thinks is happening.

### 2. We Build Rails
We don't build isolated solutions. We build rails that connect systems. Just like railroads connected isolated towns, we connect WhatsApp, Excel, SAP, Oracle, and people's heads so information can flow and AI can actually work.

### 3. We Ship, Not Slide
We don't deliver PowerPoints—we deliver working systems. Our clients have:
- Contract automation processing 250 contracts/day
- Service Desk mini-apps with email/WhatsApp integration
- Real-time financial dashboards across multiple business units
- Chatbots with user hierarchies deployed
- HR bots collecting and updating employee documents

Not decks. Not prototypes. Production systems.

## The Moat (What Makes Us Defensible)

### Today (Weak Moat)
| Asset | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Methodology | Proven once, not codified |
| Data | 68 interviews, single client |
| Relationships | GDM, DRUO, investor network |
| Technology | system0 prototype, not productized |

### Year 1 Target (Growing Moat)
| Asset | Target |
|-------|--------|
| Methodology | Documented playbooks for 3 industries |
| Data | 200+ interviews across 5+ clients |
| Relationships | 5-7 enterprise clients, referral engine |
| Technology | Director AI deployed at 3+ clients |

### Year 3 Target (Strong Moat)
| Asset | Target |
|-------|--------|
| Methodology | Industry-standard for LatAm AI implementation |
| Data | Proprietary benchmark data across industries |
| Relationships | Preferred partner for major hospitality/F&B chains |
| Technology | Director AI with network effects (shared learnings) |

---

## What's Missing? (Gaps to Close)

### 1. PROPRIETARY DATA MOAT
**Gap:** We have 68 interviews from one client. That's not a moat.
**Solution:** Every engagement feeds a benchmark database. "Your process takes 4 hours; industry average is 45 minutes." Clients pay for the insight, not just the fix.

### 2. SWITCHING COSTS
**Gap:** If we leave, client can hire someone else.
**Solution:** Director AI becomes the brain. Once it knows where everything is, replacing it is painful. Embed deeply, then maintain.

### 3. NETWORK EFFECTS
**Gap:** Each client is isolated.
**Solution:** Anonymized learnings across clients. "We've seen this problem at 12 companies; here's what works." Clients benefit from the collective.

### 4. BRAND POSITIONING
**Gap:** "AI consulting" is crowded and commoditized.
**Solution:** Own "Organizational Archaeology" as a category. Be THE company that excavates hidden process debt in LatAm enterprises.

### 5. RECURRING REVENUE
**Gap:** 100% project-based today.
**Solution:** Director AI subscription + maintenance retainers. Target: 40% recurring by end of Year 1.

# PART 5: THE VISION

## 10-Year Target

> **$10M ARR as the definitive AI implementation partner for LatAm enterprises.**

**What that looks like:**
- 50+ enterprise clients
- <20 person team (high leverage)
- Playbooks for 5+ industries
- The name people say when asked "who does AI implementation in Latin America?"

---

## 3-Year Picture (January 2029)

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Revenue | $2M USD |
| Gross Margin | 60% |
| Net Profit | $600K |
| Clients | 15-20 enterprise accounts |
| Team | 8-12 people |
| Recurring Revenue | 40%+ of total |

**What it feels like:**
- Product clarity achieved—we know exactly what we sell
- Clients refer other clients—growth comes from reputation
- Team runs without founders in every meeting
- We turn down more work than we accept

---

## Why Now?

1. **AI anxiety is peaking.** Every enterprise CEO fears being left behind. They'll pay for clarity.

2. **LatAm is underserved.** US/EU consultants don't understand the market. Local players lack AI depth.

3. **The tools are ready.** Claude, GPT-4, WhatsApp APIs—the building blocks exist. Someone needs to assemble them for this market.

4. **We've done the hard part.** 68 interviews, 3 active clients, multiple products deployed in production. Contract automation processing 250 contracts/day. Not prototypes—working systems.

5. **Repository-based infrastructure.** We operate through GitHub repos, not broken files. Our development process (ADW - Agent Development Workflow) is systematized and scalable.
