# PART 1: WHO WE ARE

## Founding Team

| Role | Person | Monthly (USD) | Equity | Brings |
|------|--------|---------------|--------|--------|
| **Co-Founder (Vision/Sales)** | Daniel Cardona | $6,000 | 50% | Sales, client relationships, system architecture, organizational archaeology |
| **Co-Founder (Product/Delivery)** | Daniel Restrepo | $8,250 | 50% | Production engineering, delivery discipline, AI agent development |

**Total Founder Cost:** $14,250/month | $171,000/year

**Equity Principle:** Higher salary = compensation for taking less financial risk. Both founders committed equally; salary difference is acknowledged and accepted.

## Core Values

### 1. WONDER EYES
**We search for truth through curiosity.**

We don't accept "that's how we've always done it." We ask why until we understand. We dig into organizations like archaeologists—not to judge, but to discover what's really happening beneath the surface.

*Test: Did we ask enough questions before proposing a solution?*

---

### 2. WE BUILD COOL SHIT
**We only ship work we're proud of.**

If we wouldn't use it ourselves, we don't deliver it. We'd rather say no to a project than deliver something mediocre. Our reputation is built one deliverable at a time.

*Test: Would we show this to our smartest friend without embarrassment?*

---

### 3. DESIGN IS USEFUL
**Good design works. Pretty is a side effect.**

We don't make things look good—we make things work well. When something works perfectly, it usually looks good too. We optimize for function, then refine for form.

*Test: Does this solve the problem, or does it just look like it does?*

---

### 4. NO BULLSHIT
**We communicate clearly. The first time.**

No jargon. No hiding behind complexity. If we can't explain it simply, we don't understand it well enough. We respect people's time by being direct.

*Test: Would a smart 15-year-old understand what we just said?*

---

### 5. OUTCOMES OVER ACTIVITY
**We measure results, not hours.**

We don't care how long something takes—we care what it produces. Reduced headcount. Faster processes. More revenue. Lower costs. If we can't measure the impact, we didn't create value.

*Test: Can we put a number on what we delivered?*

---

# PART 2: WHAT WE DO

## The Problem We Solve

**Large LatAm enterprises are drowning in informal processes and legacy systems.**

They have:
- 100+ systems with 15-30% actual usage
- Knowledge trapped in people's heads, not systems
- No visibility into where automation would actually help
- Fear of "being left behind" on AI, but no roadmap

They've tried:
- Hiring consultants who deliver PowerPoints, not results
- Buying software that nobody uses
- Internal "digital transformation" projects that stall

**They need someone who will dig in, understand the reality, and deliver measurable outcomes.**

## What We Actually Deliver

**We only get paid for outcomes. These are the only four that matter:**

| Outcome | How We Measure | Example |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| **Reduce Headcount** | FTEs eliminated or redeployed | 4 conciliation roles → 0 = $48K/year saved |
| **Optimize Process** | Hours saved per week/month | Contract generation: 4 hours → 15 minutes |
| **Increase Revenue** | $ directly attributed | Call center automation → 20% more bookings |
| **Reduce Costs** | CAC, COGS, or overhead reduction | Lead qualification → 30% lower CAC |

**If we can't tie our work to one of these four outcomes, we don't do the project.**

---

# PART 3: WHY WE WIN

## Value Proposition (One Sentence)

> **We find $500K+ in automation opportunities inside LatAm enterprises, then we build the first ones to prove they work.**

---

## Why Us? (3 Uniques)

### 1. Organizational Archaeology
We don't trust org charts. We interview everyone—68 interviews, 2,748 entities extracted, 292 automation opportunities identified in our first engagement. We see what's actually happening, not what the CEO thinks is happening.

### 2. LatAm Native
Spanish-first. We understand that WhatsApp is the real operating system. We know that "mañana" means next week. We've worked inside LatAm enterprises and know where the bodies are buried.

### 3. We Ship, Not Slide
We don't deliver PowerPoints—we deliver working systems. Our first client has automations running in production, not decks sitting in a folder.

---

## The Moat (What Makes Us Defensible)

### Today (Weak Moat)
| Asset | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Methodology | Proven once, not codified |
| Data | 68 interviews, single client |
| Relationships | GDM, DRUO, investor network |
| Technology | system0 prototype, not productized |

### Year 1 Target (Growing Moat)
| Asset | Target |
|-------|--------|
| Methodology | Documented playbooks for 3 industries |
| Data | 200+ interviews across 5+ clients |
| Relationships | 5-7 enterprise clients, referral engine |
| Technology | Director AI deployed at 3+ clients |

### Year 3 Target (Strong Moat)
| Asset | Target |
|-------|--------|
| Methodology | Industry-standard for LatAm AI implementation |
| Data | Proprietary benchmark data across industries |
| Relationships | Preferred partner for major hospitality/F&B chains |
| Technology | Director AI with network effects (shared learnings) |

---

## What's Missing? (Gaps to Close)

### 1. PROPRIETARY DATA MOAT
**Gap:** We have 68 interviews from one client. That's not a moat.
**Solution:** Every engagement feeds a benchmark database. "Your process takes 4 hours; industry average is 45 minutes." Clients pay for the insight, not just the fix.

### 2. SWITCHING COSTS
**Gap:** If we leave, client can hire someone else.
**Solution:** Director AI becomes the brain. Once it knows where everything is, replacing it is painful. Embed deeply, then maintain.

### 3. NETWORK EFFECTS
**Gap:** Each client is isolated.
**Solution:** Anonymized learnings across clients. "We've seen this problem at 12 companies; here's what works." Clients benefit from the collective.

### 4. BRAND POSITIONING
**Gap:** "AI consulting" is crowded and commoditized.
**Solution:** Own "Organizational Archaeology" as a category. Be THE company that excavates hidden process debt in LatAm enterprises.

### 5. RECURRING REVENUE
**Gap:** 100% project-based today.
**Solution:** Director AI subscription + maintenance retainers. Target: 40% recurring by end of Year 1.

---

# PART 5: THE VISION

## 10-Year Target

> **$10M ARR as the definitive AI implementation partner for LatAm enterprises.**

**What that looks like:**
- 50+ enterprise clients
- <20 person team (high leverage)
- Playbooks for 5+ industries
- The name people say when asked "who does AI implementation in Latin America?"

---

## 3-Year Picture (January 2029)

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Revenue | $2M USD |
| Gross Margin | 60% |
| Net Profit | $600K |
| Clients | 15-20 enterprise accounts |
| Team | 8-12 people |
| Recurring Revenue | 40%+ of total |

**What it feels like:**
- Product clarity achieved—we know exactly what we sell
- Clients refer other clients—growth comes from reputation
- Team runs without founders in every meeting
- We turn down more work than we accept

---

## Why Now?

1. **AI anxiety is peaking.** Every enterprise CEO fears being left behind. They'll pay for clarity.

2. **LatAm is underserved.** US/EU consultants don't understand the market. Local players lack AI depth.

3. **The tools are ready.** Claude, GPT-4, WhatsApp APIs—the building blocks exist. Someone needs to assemble them for this market.

4. **We've done the hard part.** 68 interviews, one proven client, working methodology. We're not starting from zero.
