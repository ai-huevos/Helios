Hi [Name],

I'm testing new positioning and would love 30 seconds of feedback.

Current: "Fractional CMO for AI Companies"
Testing: "Revenue Systems Engineer for Technical Founders"

The idea: Instead of marketing campaigns, I build revenue systems that work while you focus on product.

Quick thought - which resonates more for a technical founder with revenue plateaus?

Thanks!
[Your name]

P.S. If you know any technical founders struggling with revenue systems, I'm testing some new frameworks that might help.
```

**Target**: Technical founders, CTOs, engineering leaders at B2B companies
**Message Template**:
```
Hi [Name],

I help technical founders build revenue systems that work as reliably as their code.

Most technical teams nail the product but struggle with systematic revenue generation. 

I've developed AI-powered revenue systems that work while you focus on what you do best - building.

Worth a 15-minute conversation to see if this applies to [Company]?

Best,
[Your name]
Revenue Systems Engineer
