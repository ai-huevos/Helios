## 🎯 VALIDATION QUESTION FRAMEWORK

### For Marketing ROI Assessment:

3. "What percentage of your current pipeline comes from marketing efforts vs direct sales outreach?"

### For Product-Market Fit Validation:
1. "For your newest service line, what's the profile of clients who show immediate interest vs those who don't engage?"
2. "How do existing clients describe the business impact of your solution in their own words?"
3. "What specific problems do prospects mention when they decide not to move forward?"

### For Cash Flow & Growth Balance:
1. "If you had to choose between immediate revenue opportunities and long-term scalability investments, how would you prioritize?"
2. "What's your minimum viable monthly recurring revenue to sustain current operations and growth plans?"
3. "Which growth initiatives could you pause for 90 days without significantly impacting long-term success?"

### For Emotional/Personal Sales Blocks:
1. "What specific aspects of self-promotion feel most uncomfortable, and what would make them feel more authentic?"
