# Activate Co-CEO for Brand Book Consolidation

## Quick Activation

Copy and paste this prompt to activate the Co-CEO agent for brand book consolidation:

---

```
I want to talk to the Co-CEO agent. Please load the system prompt from:
workflows/agent-deployment/co-ceo/CO_CEO_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md

And make all artifacts available from:
research/agent-specifications/co-ceo/artifacts/

Now, I need you to execute the brand book consolidation task. Please read and follow the instructions in:
workflows/agent-deployment/co-ceo/BRAND_BOOK_CONSOLIDATION_PROMPT.md

Also reference the file organization plan at:
Brand/FILE_ORGANIZATION_PLAN.md

Start with Phase 1: Audit & Inventory. Show me:
1. A complete list of all brand files currently in the Brand/ directory
2. Identify what content is duplicated across files
3. List all Spanglish issues you find
4. Map the current structure vs. the target structure from the organization plan

Once you've completed the audit, we'll proceed phase by phase.
```

## What This Will Do

The Co-CEO agent will:

1. ✅ **Audit all brand files** - Create complete inventory
2. ✅ **Consolidate content** - Merge into organized brand book structure
3. ✅ **Create bilingual versions** - English + Spanish for all content
4. ✅ **Fix Spanglish** - Clean language separation
5. ✅ **Reorganize files** - Follow repository structure rules
6. ✅ **Validate consistency** - Check against strategic DNA and artifacts

## Expected Timeline

- **Phase 1 (Audit):** 15-30 minutes
- **Phase 2 (Consolidation):** 1-2 hours
- **Phase 3 (Language Fix):** 30-60 minutes

**Total:** ~3-5 hours of work, but can be done incrementally

## Tips

- **Work incrementally:** Don't try to do everything at once
- **Review as you go:** Check each phase before moving to next
- **Test links:** After reorganization, verify all internal links work
- **Backup first:** Consider creating a branch before major reorganization
