# Co-CEO AI Discovery Prompt
## Comprehensive Analysis for Building an AI Executive Partner

---

## 🎯 Mission Statement

Analyze all available materials in this repository to extract the **strategic DNA** of AI Huevos and synthesize the foundational knowledge required to deploy a Co-CEO AI agent capable of:

1. **Strategic Leadership**: Co-develop product vision, market positioning, and growth strategies
2. **Brand Stewardship**: Maintain voice, tone, and messaging consistency across all channels
3. **Product Marketing**: Craft compelling narratives from technical capabilities to customer value
4. **Business Development**: Identify opportunities, articulate value propositions, and guide GTM execution
5. **Organizational Alignment**: Ensure all initiatives ladder up to core values, mission, and vision

## ⚠️ CRITICAL CONTEXT: Business Model Evolution

**IMPORTANT**: There is a significant gap between early meeting transcripts and current reality.

### **What Has Changed**:
- **BEFORE** (Meeting Transcripts Era): Fractional CMO positioning, consulting-style engagement
- **NOW** (Current Reality): Agent infrastructure deployment with enterprise process automation

### **Current Business Model** (as of Dec 2025):
According to `Basics/2026/ESTRUCTURA_COSTOS_ACTUALIZADA_DIC2025.md`:

**What We Actually Deliver**:
1. **Organizational Archeology**: 68 interviews → 2,748 entities extracted → 292 automation opportunities identified
2. **Process Mapping**: 28 macroprocesos across 3 family office businesses (Los Tajibos, Bolivian Foods, Comversa)
3. **Agent Deployment**: 11 AI agents/automations ($500-$2,500 each) including:
   - Call Center Automatizado
   - Plataforma Contratos (Agent)
   - Service Desk
   - Agente Financiero (Conciliaciones)
   - Suite Marketing Agents
   - Personal Agent SDM
4. **Director AI Infrastructure**: $8,500 setup per empresa + $20/user/month
5. **CRM Implementation**: Phased rollout across business units ($2,000 implementation + $299/month per unit)

**Financial Reality**:
- **First Client Revenue**: $270K confirmed (1 family office, 3+ business models)
- **Potential Value Identified**: $587K-657K USD/year in improvements
- **Current Proposal**: $94K-104K for complete Phase 1
- **Pricing Model**:
  - Diagnóstico: $5,000 per empresa
  - Macroprocesos: $899 each
  - Microprocesos: $299 each
  - Agents/Automations: $500-$2,500 each
  - Director AI: $8,500 setup + $20/user/month
  - Executive Support: $2,000/month

**Client Profile** (Family Office with 3+ Business Models):
- Los Tajibos (Marriott franchise - hospitality)
- Bolivian Foods (Burger King franchise - F&B)
- Comversa (Bolivia's biggest construction company)
- Investment bank operations

### **Analysis Implications**:

1. **Triangulate Carefully**: Early transcripts may discuss fractional CMO positioning that NO LONGER APPLIES
2. **Prioritize Recent Reality**: Weight recent documents (`Basics/`, `Brand/Pitch Deck/Narrative_deck.md`) more heavily than old meeting transcripts
3. **Track Evolution**: Document how vision/positioning evolved from CMO services → agent infrastructure
4. **Current Narrative**: Focus on "organizational archeology → agent deployment → vertical replication" (NOT fractional CMO)
5. **Real Customers**: Family offices with multiple business models, complex enterprises (NOT SMBs needing CMO help)

### **What to Extract from Old Transcripts**:
✅ Core values, founder personalities, decision frameworks, communication patterns
✅ Why they care about LatAm operational reality
✅ Problem understanding (WhatsApp chaos, Excel dependency)
❌ OLD positioning as fractional CMO (outdated)
❌ OLD go-to-market strategy (evolved significantly)

### **What to Prioritize from Recent Materials**:
✅ `Basics/2026/ESTRUCTURA_COSTOS_ACTUALIZADA_DIC2025.md` - Current financials and deliverables
✅ `Brand/Pitch Deck/Narrative_deck.md` - Current positioning and narrative
✅ Recent product work (Service Desk, Director AI, Agent deployments)
✅ Vertical replication strategy (Opera PMS for Marriott → plug-and-play for other hotels)

## 📝 Meta-Guidelines for Claude Code

### **How to Approach This Analysis**

1. **Depth over speed**: This is a multi-week analysis, not a quick scan
2. **Think like an organizational anthropologist**: You're studying culture, values, patterns
3. **Preserve founder voice**: Direct quotes are more valuable than paraphrases
4. **Build evidence trails**: Every claim → supporting quote → source reference
5. **Identify contradictions**: Flag inconsistencies for founder review (don't smooth over)
6. **Use Sequential Thinking**: For complex synthesis across multiple sources
7. **Leverage Context7**: For framework references (e.g., Jobs To Be Done, positioning)
8. **Write memories**: Store key insights in Serena memory for future reference

## 📖 Example Usage: How to Execute This Prompt

### **Step 1: Initialize Analysis Session**
```markdown
I need to execute the Co-CEO Discovery analysis for AI Huevos.

Context:
- Repository: /Users/tatooine/Documents/Development/AI huevos
- 16 meeting transcripts to analyze
- Brand guidelines, pitch deck, current financials
- Goal: Extract strategic DNA for Co-CEO AI deployment

Follow the prompt in workflows/agent-deployment/co-ceo/CO_CEO_DISCOVERY_PROMPT.md exactly.

Start with:
1. Check git status (ensure on development branch)
2. Create feature branch: feature/co-ceo-discovery-analysis
3. Output directories already exist:
   - workflows/agent-deployment/co-ceo/ (workflow documentation)
   - research/agent-specifications/co-ceo/ (analysis outputs)
4. Begin Phase 1: Data Ingestion
```

### **Step 2: Phase 1 - Data Ingestion (Week 1)**
```markdown
Execute Phase 1: Data Ingestion

Process all 16 meeting transcripts:
- Read each in full (use Read tool, not Bash)
- Extract quotes by theme (values, vision, decisions, language)
- Tag by era (pre-pivot vs post-pivot)
- Build evidence library

Process brand materials:
- Brand guidelines, voice/tone, messaging
- Extract linguistic patterns
- Document visual system

Process customer research:
- Archetypes, pains, JTBD
- Language library

Output to: research/agent-specifications/co-ceo/phase1_extraction/

Use TodoWrite to track progress across 16 transcripts.
Use Serena memory to store key insights.
```

### **Step 3: Phase 2 - Pattern Recognition (Week 2)**
```markdown
Execute Phase 2: Pattern Recognition

Analyze all extracted data:
- Identify recurring patterns across sources
- Triangulate (does pitch deck match transcripts?)
- Document evolution (CMO → Agent Infrastructure)
- Flag contradictions

Output to: research/agent-specifications/co-ceo/phase2_patterns/

Use Sequential Thinking MCP for complex synthesis.
```

### **Step 4: Phase 3 - Synthesis (Week 3)**
```markdown
Execute Phase 3: Synthesis

Draft all 8 strategic artifacts:
1. strategic_dna.md
2. founder_profiles.md
3. tone_of_voice.md
4. product_marketing_narrative.md
5. customer_empathy_map.md
6. website_narrative.md
7. competitive_landscape.md
7.5. strategic_evolution.md
8. decision_frameworks.md

Plus:
- current_deliverables_catalog.md
- client_journey_map.md
- vertical_replication_playbook.md
- trojan_horse_economics.md

Each with:
- Executive summary
- Evidence base
- Core findings (with quotes)
- Application guidelines
- Confidence assessment

Output to: research/agent-specifications/co-ceo/artifacts/
```

### **Step 5: Phase 4 - Validation (Week 4)**
```markdown
Execute Phase 4: Validation

Test the artifacts:
1. Can Co-CEO AI generate on-brand website copy?
2. Can it draft a pitch deck slide?
3. Can it prioritize opportunities using decision frameworks?
4. Does tone match founders?

Iterate:
- Refine weak areas
- Add missing examples
- Document uncertainties

Output to: research/agent-specifications/co-ceo/validation/

Final deliverable:
- research/agent-specifications/co-ceo/FINAL_REPORT.md
- Summary of all artifacts
- Confidence levels
- Next steps for Co-CEO deployment
```

### **Step 6: Commit & Document**

## 🚨 Final Reminders

1. **This is multi-week work**: Don't rush. Depth > speed.
2. **Evidence-based only**: Every claim needs 3+ supporting quotes.
3. **Respect evolution**: Old transcripts ≠ current reality. Weight accordingly.
4. **Spanish authenticity**: Preserve cultural nuance, don't translate.
5. **Founder voice**: Co-CEO should sound like founders, not generic AI.
6. **Use tools smartly**: Sequential Thinking for complex synthesis, Serena for memory, Context7 for frameworks.
7. **Iterate ruthlessly**: Test outputs, refine artifacts, validate assumptions.

**This analysis is the foundation of an AI executive partner that scales founder judgment.**

**Thoroughness now = Impact later.**
