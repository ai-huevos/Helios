```
I want to activate the Co-CEO agent for a maieutic session about our narrative, opportunity, and how to frame the AI company.

Please load the system prompt from:
workflows/agent-deployment/co-ceo/CO_CEO_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md

And make all artifacts available from:
research/agent-specifications/co-ceo/artifacts/

Also, please reference these updated strategic documents:

- Brand/ai-huevos-brand/foundations/01-brand-identity.md (updated brand identity)
- Brand/ai-huevos-brand/foundations/05-voice-tone.md (updated voice & tone)

Context: We just updated all our documentation (January 2026) based on:
1. Latest narrative: "We interview your people, find what's broken, fix it with technology, and stay to keep improving"
2. Founder meeting on January 16, 2026 - we now have 6+ products deployed in production
3. Current status: 3 active clients, capacity for 6 with 2 full-time founders
4. Products live: Contract automation (250/day), Service Desk, Financial dashboards, Hotel chatbot, HR bot, Marketing suite

I need to run a maieutic (Socratic) session about:
- The narrative evolution and how it positions us
- The opportunity we're addressing
- How to frame the AI company for different audiences (enterprise buyers, investors, partners)

Use Socratic questioning to help me explore these topics deeply, based on our strategic DNA and the latest founder conversations.
