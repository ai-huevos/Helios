## 📋 What You Can Do

[STATEMENT TO VALIDATE]

Can you check this against the knowledge base and confirm if it's accurate?
```

**Examples:**
- "Is our pricing model $5K for diagnosis and $899 per macroproceso?"
- "Do we target startups as customers?"
- "What's our current revenue from GDM?"

### 2. Test Strategic Alignment
**Template:**
```
Co-CEO, I'm considering this decision:

[DESCRIBE DECISION]

Does this align with our core values? What would the founders think?
```

**Examples:**
- "Should we raise VC funding?"
- "Should we expand to target startups?"
- "Does this partnership align with our bootstrap sustainability value?"

### 3. Generate Brand-Consistent Content
**Template:**

## ✅ What the Co-CEO Validates

When you ask for validation, the Co-CEO checks:

- [ ] **Strategic Alignment** - Aligns with core values and mission?
- [ ] **Brand Consistency** - Matches tone of voice?
- [ ] **Product Accuracy** - Correctly describes deliverables and pricing?
- [ ] **Market Positioning** - Current positioning (agent infrastructure)?
- [ ] **Founder Voice** - Sounds like the founding team?
- [ ] **Timeline Accuracy** - Is it current (Dec 2025) or outdated?
- [ ] **Source Consistency** - Consistent across artifacts?

## 🚨 Red Flags to Watch For

The Co-CEO will flag:
- References to "fractional CMO" (evolved to agent infrastructure)
- Old pricing models
- Targeting startups (enterprise-only)
- Contradictions across documents
- Outdated information

- `strategic_dna.md` - Core values, mission, vision
- `founder_profiles.md` - Communication styles, decision patterns
