## The Operational Intelligence Layer for LatAm Enterprises

---

## THE ONE-LINER

**We turn the chaotic reality of LatAm operations into a measurable, improvable system—so companies can see what's actually happening, automate what hurts, and scale without adding headcount.**

---

## THE PROBLEM (Why This Matters)

### What We See Every Day

LatAm enterprises with $50M-$500M+ in revenue run on:
- **WhatsApp** as the real communication layer
- **Excel** as the real database
- **Tribal knowledge** as the real process documentation

The result:

| Symptom | Real Cost |
|---------|-----------|
| Information arrives late | Decisions made on stale data |
| 100+ systems, 15-30% actual usage | $500K+/year in wasted licenses |
| Knowledge trapped in people's heads | Key person leaves = chaos |
| Manual reconciliation, contracts, reports | 4 FTEs doing what should take 1 |

**We've seen this at Finkargo (trade finance, $300M+ in loans), and now at GDM (Grupo Doria Medina) - a family office holding with 3+ companies: Los Tajibos (Marriott franchise), Bolivian Foods (Burger King franchise), and Comversa (Bolivia's biggest construction company).**

### Why Technology Alone Doesn't Fix It

Every enterprise has tried:
- ERP implementations that took 2 years and delivered 30% of promise
- "Digital transformation" projects that produced PowerPoints, not results
- AI consultants who diagnosed but couldn't implement

**The gap isn't technology. It's translation.**

Someone needs to:
1. Understand the REAL operating system (not the org chart)
2. Build automations that work with WhatsApp, Excel, and legacy systems
3. Train internal teams to maintain and improve
4. Measure outcomes, not activities

That's us.

---

## WHAT WE DO (The Method)

### Phase 1: Organizational Archaeology
**Duration:** 2-4 weeks | **Output:** Company Map + Automation Roadmap

We don't trust org charts. We interview everyone.

**Example: GDM (Grupo Doria Medina)**
- 68 interviews across 3 companies (Los Tajibos, Bolivian Foods, Comversa)
- 2,748 entities extracted across 17 types
- 2,700+ data points linked into enterprise graph
- 28 macroprocesses identified
- 292 automation opportunities identified
- **$587K-657K USD/year in potential value** identified

We find the REAL workflows, the REAL bottlenecks, the REAL costs.

**Deliverable:** A map of where money is being burned and how to stop it.

**Example Output:**
> "Your conciliation process has 4 people spending 3 days/week on tasks that should take 2 hours. Automating this saves $48K/year and eliminates 12 days of lag in your financial data."

### Phase 2: Rapid Automation (Implementation Bundle)
**Duration:** 2-8 weeks per bundle | **Output:** Working systems

We don't build for 6 months. We ship in weeks.

**The Implementation Bundle includes:**
- **Macroprocesos** ($899 each) - High-level process mapping and optimization
- **Microprocesos** ($299 each) - Granular process automation
- **Agents/Automations** ($500-$2,500 each) - AI agents for specific tasks
- **System Integration** - Connects WhatsApp, Excel, Oracle, SAP, existing infrastructure

**The Loop:**
```
Operator feedback → Issue logged → Agentic dev workflow → 
Human review → Updated agent → Measured improvement
Time to improve: 20-30 hours, not months
```

Every automation we build:
- Works with their existing systems (WhatsApp, Excel, Oracle, SAP)
- Has instrumentation (who did what, how long, what result)
- Generates data that feeds back into improvement

### Phase 3: Train & Transition
**Duration:** 4-8 weeks | **Output:** Internal capability

We don't want to do reconciliation for 3 years. We want to:
1. Build the automation
2. Train their team to operate and improve it
3. Move to the next high-value problem

**This is how we scale:** Not by hiring 50 people, but by creating capability inside client organizations and moving to where we add most value.

### Phase 4: Director AI (The Brain)
**Setup:** $8,500 per company (one-time) | **Ongoing:** $20/user/month

**Why the setup fee?** Complexity. We're building an intelligence layer that maps your entire company—processes, people, systems, data flows. This requires significant upfront work: integrating with existing systems, mapping organizational structure, training the AI on your specific operations. The $8,500 covers this foundation work.

**Once we've mapped and automated, we leave behind an intelligence layer:**
- All company knowledge in one queryable system
- Cross-department visibility for leadership
- Continuous improvement recommendations
- Operator-in-the-loop feedback system

**This is recurring revenue and this is the moat.**

## WHAT WE'VE DONE (Proof from GDM)

### Grupo Doria Medina (GDM) - Our First Enterprise Client

**The Holding Structure:**
- **Los Tajibos** - Marriott franchise (hospitality)
- **Bolivian Foods** - Burger King franchise (F&B)
- **Comversa** - Bolivia's biggest construction company

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Interviews conducted | 68 across 3 companies |
| Entities extracted | 2,748 across 17 types |
| Data points linked | 2,700+ |
| Macroprocesses identified | 28 (vs 8 originally scoped) |
| Opportunities identified | 292 automations |
| Potential annual savings | **$587K-657K USD/year** |
| Contract value | $94K (Comversa + DRUO) |

**Status:** $37K paid, automations in production, $57K pending

**What we built for them:**
- Service Desk with self-service capabilities
- Contract automation platform (agents)
- Financial reconciliation automation
- Cross-company dashboard (operational + financial KPIs)
- 11 agents/automations deployed or in progress

**The Replication Play:**
- Workflows built for Los Tajibos (Marriott) → reusable for other hotels
- Bolivian Foods systems → template for other F&B operations
- Comversa construction workflows → scalable to other builders

This is vertical replication: build once, replicate across industries.

### Finkargo (Colombia) - Where We Learned

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Years involved | 3 (early hires) |
| Growth contribution | 0 → $300M in loans |
| Role (Cardona) | Growth & Revenue Operations |
| Role (Restrepo) | Operations & Process Architecture |

**What we learned:** How LatAm enterprises actually operate, what makes them fundable, where technology creates vs destroys value.

### Current Pipeline

| Client | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| GDM (Comversa + DRUO) | $94K | Active ($37K paid, $57K pending) |
| **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)** | **$3.2K** | From Director AI subscriptions |
| **Total Confirmed** | **$94K + MRR** | |

## THE BUSINESS MODEL

### Three Revenue Layers

| Layer | What | Price | Margin |
|-------|------|-------|--------|
| **Diagnosis** | Company Map + Roadmap | $5K per company | 70%+ |
| **Implementation Bundle** | Macroprocesos + Microprocesos + Agents + Automations | $15-50K per bundle | 50-60% |
| **Director AI** | Setup + Ongoing intelligence | $8,500 setup + $20/user/mo | 80%+ |

**Implementation Bundle Breakdown:**
- Macroprocesos: $899 each (28 identified at GDM)
- Microprocesos: $299 each (35 critical ones at GDM)
- Agents/Automations: $500-$2,500 each (11 deployed/in progress at GDM)
- **Total typical bundle:** $15-50K depending on scope

### Natural Expansion

Every diagnostic generates 3-5 implementation projects.
Every implementation generates maintenance + expansion.
Every company in a holding creates a template for sister companies.

### The Holding Advantage

When we work with a multi-company holding like GDM:
- Diagnosis in Company A reveals patterns that apply to B, C
- Automation built for A is 60% reusable in B
- Training in A creates internal champions who spread capability
- Director AI spans the entire holding = single source of truth for leadership

**This is why the partnership with Tomás's network is strategic, not just a contract.**

## WHY US (And Why Now)

### The Team

**Daniel Cardona** – CEO
- 3 years at Finkargo (early hire)
- Growth & Revenue Operations
- 110+ automated processes across 9 areas
- Sees systems where others see chaos

**Daniel Restrepo** – COO
- 3 years at Finkargo (early hire)
- Operations & Process Architecture
- $150M+ pipeline in B2B
- Makes things actually work

**Tomás Shuk** – Strategic Partner
- Serial entrepreneur

### Why Now

1. **We've proven the method at GDM** – 68 interviews → 292 opportunities → $587K+ value identified → automations in production
2. **LatAm is underserved** – McKinsey can diagnose but can't implement. Local shops can implement but can't diagnose.
3. **The holding network is ready** – Confíe, Huevos Quique, OPL Carga all need this. Now.
4. **Vertical replication is validated** – Workflows built for one business model (Marriott) are template for others (hotels)

---

## THE VISION (Where This Goes)

### The Railroad Analogy

Think about the first organizational chart for railroads. Before railroads, you had roads—everyone built their own path, no standardization, no shared infrastructure.

**What we're building is like that first railroad infrastructure for LatAm enterprises:**

1. **First, you lay the rails** (organizational archaeology) - Map where work actually flows
2. **Then, you build the stations** (process automation) - Nodes where work connects
3. **Finally, you run the trains** (AI agents) - Technology that moves work efficiently

**But here's the key:** Their teams build the roads of automation. We're the ones who say "let's add a railway here first, then the stations, then the trains—just like technology should be built."

This is systematic, not chaotic. This is infrastructure, not point solutions.

### Year 1: Prove the Model
- 5-7 enterprise clients
- $300K+ revenue
- Playbooks for logistics, hospitality, F&B (validated from GDM)
- Director AI with paying users ($3.2K MRR growing)

### Year 2: Scale the Network
- 15-20 clients across the holding network
- 5 trained implementation partners
- $1M+ ARR
- Regional expansion: Bolivia + Colombia + Peru

### Year 3+: The Infrastructure Play

**What we're really building:**

> The operational data layer where LatAm enterprises and their vendors transact work with full traceability and performance data.

- Companies plug in their workflows
- Agents (human or AI) plug in their capabilities
- The platform measures performance, compares benchmarks
- Eventually: route work to the best agents, provide better financing terms based on operational performance

**This is "Enterprise MCP for LatAm."**

We've seen at Finkargo which businesses get funded. The ones with operational clarity. We're building the system that creates that clarity.

## THE PARTNERSHIP PROPOSAL

### What We Bring

- Proven methodology at GDM (68 interviews → 292 opportunities → $587K+ value)
- Working product (11 automations deployed/in production)
- Technical founders who implement, not just advise
- 3+ years inside LatAm enterprise operations (Finkargo)
- Vertical replication validated (Marriott → other hotels template)

### What We Need

- Access to companies that need this (Confíe, Huevos Quique, OPL Carga, José's holdings)
- Long-term partnership, not project-by-project
- Strategic capital for security (founders) and to scale quickly
- Strategic guidance on holding structure and growth

### The Strategic Partnership Structure

**We're bootstrap-sustainable and profitable today.** We're not asking for capital to survive—we're asking for a strategic partnership that accelerates growth while providing security for founders.

**Why we need capital:**
- **Security for founders** - Allows us to take strategic risks, build team without personal financial strain
- **Scale quickly** - Hire 2-3 technical builders, accelerate Director AI productization
- **Runway buffer** - Cover gap between expenses and revenue during expansion

**Structure options:**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Equity partner** | AI Huevos as part of the holding, serving all portfolio companies |
| **Preferred vendor** | Discounted rates for holding companies, full rates for external |
| **Hybrid** | Small equity stake + revenue share on external contracts |

### What We Deliver

| Outcome | How We Measure |
|---------|----------------|
| Reduce Headcount | FTEs eliminated or redeployed |
| Optimize Process | Hours saved per week/month |
| Increase Revenue | $ directly attributed |
| Reduce Costs | CAC, COGS, overhead reduction |

**If we can't tie our work to one of these four outcomes, we don't do the project.**

---

## THE ASK

### Strategic Partnership, Not Fundraising

We're not raising VC money. We're proposing to be the technology arm of a multi-company holding.

**Capital Needs (For Team Building & Security):**

| Item | Amount | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| 12-month runway buffer | $150-200K | Cover gap between expenses and revenue + founder security |
| Team expansion | Included | 2-3 technical hires to accelerate |
| Tool stack | Included | AI APIs, infrastructure |
| Director AI R&D | Included | Productization, agent templates, benchmarks |

**This isn't "give us money and trust us." This is "work with us strategically, see results, grow together."**
