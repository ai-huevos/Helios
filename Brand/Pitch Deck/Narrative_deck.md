# AI Huevos Pitch Deck - Narrative Draft v1

## The 90-Second Spine (Memorize This)

> "Right now, big LatAm enterprises run on WhatsApp, Excel, and people's heads. Everyone's talking about AI, but there's no operating system to plug agents into.
>
> At AI Huevos, we go inside as organizational archeologists. We map the real operating system, deploy agentic workflows, and instrument everything so every action becomes data.
>
> The result is an operator-in-the-loop engine: operators flag what's broken, our agentic dev workflows propose fixes, a human approves, and the agent improves—usually in under 30 hours. Every cycle becomes performance data.
>
> We've already shipped 7 products in 5 months for our first enterprise client—a family office with 3+ business models including Marriott franchise, Burger King franchise, Bolivia's biggest construction company, and an investment bank. $270K confirmed revenue, $1.5M potential value identified. The beauty: once we build workflows for one business model, we can replicate vertically across industries—Opera PMS for Marriott becomes plug-and-play for other hotels.
>
> We built the growth engine at Finkargo—$670M in merchandise value, 570+ entrepreneurs, Series A at $95M. We know which operational levers make companies fundable. Now we're productizing that into Director AI: the infrastructure where enterprises, agents, and capital transact with full traceability.
>
> Our economics prove the model: 34% gross margin at 3 clients, scaling to 67% at full capacity (6 clients). We reinvest 30-40% of workflow revenue into infrastructure build—workflows fund the platform, not capital. We're raising to unlock full capacity, productize Director AI, and scale as LatAm's default agent infrastructure."

## Slide-by-Slide Narrative

### SLIDE 1: TITLE
**What you say:**
"AI Huevos. We're building agent infrastructure for LatAm enterprises."

**On screen:**
- AI Huevos logo
- Tagline: "Agent Infrastructure for LatAm Enterprises"
- Subline: "From WhatsApp chaos to traceable agent networks"

**Purpose:** Frame as infrastructure company, not consultants.

---

### SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM
**What you say:**
"Here's the reality: $500M+ revenue companies in LatAm still run daily operations on WhatsApp, Excel, and tribal knowledge. They have 100+ systems with maybe 15-30% actual usage. There's no shared process language, no traceability, no way to know who actually performs."

**On screen:**
**Headline:** "LatAm Enterprises Run on Invisible Operating Systems"

Three pain points:
- $500M+ companies on WhatsApp + tribal knowledge
- 100+ systems per holding, 15-30% real usage  
- No process language, no traceability

**Punchline:** "There's no coherent OS to plug agents—or capital—into."

**Purpose:** Make them feel the chaos viscerally.

---

### SLIDE 3: THE INSIGHT
**What you say:**
"Everyone's selling AI copilots and dashboards. But AI without rails is useless. You can't plug agents into chaos. What's needed is shared infrastructure where workflows, agents, and vendors can connect with traceability. We're building those rails—from inside the workflows that actually move money."

**On screen:**
**Headline:** "AI Without Rails is Useless"

| TODAY | WHAT'S NEEDED |
|-------|---------------|
| One-off dashboards | Shared rails |
| Generic copilots | Process traceability |
| Each company reinvents | Standard infrastructure |

**Punchline:** "We build the rails from inside the workflows that move money."

**Purpose:** Reframe problem from "AI adoption" to "agent rails."

---

### SLIDE 4: THE WEDGE
**What you say:**
"So how do we get in? We start as organizational archeologists. We ignore org charts and official process manuals. We talk to everyone and watch how work actually happens. Our first enterprise client is a family office with 3+ business models—Marriott franchise, Burger King franchise, Bolivia's biggest construction company, and an investment bank. We did 68 interviews in 2 weeks across all their businesses. We linked 2,700+ internal datapoints. We identified 292 automation opportunities worth $1.5M in potential value. The beauty: these are complex enterprises with legacy systems. Once we build workflows for one business model, we can replicate vertically—Opera PMS for Marriott becomes plug-and-play for other hotels."

**On screen:**
**Headline:** "Our Wedge: Organizational Archeology + Vertical Replication"

Visual: Excavation → Map → Roadmap → Replicate

**First Client (Family Office):**
- Marriott franchise (hospitality)
- Burger King franchise (F&B)
- Biggest construction company in Bolivia (construction)
- Investment bank (finance)

Proof points:
- 68 interviews in 2 weeks
- 2,700+ datapoints linked
- 292 opportunities identified
- $1.5M potential value

**The Replication Play:**
- Opera PMS for Marriott → plug-and-play for other hotels
- Workflows built once, replicated vertically across industries

**Tagline:** "Build once, replicate vertically. That's the moat."

**Purpose:** Show how you enter + prove vertical replication strategy.

---

### SLIDE 5: THE PRODUCT (Holy Shit Moment)
**What you say:**
"Here's what makes us different. Most AI implementations take 3-6 months to improve. Ours? 20-30 hours from broken to fixed. The operator uses the agent, flags what's wrong directly in the platform. That becomes a structured issue. Our agentic dev workflows propose the fix. A human approves. The improved agent goes live. Every cycle is logged as data—failure patterns, fixes, KPI impact. Operators train agents, not prompts."

**On screen:**
**Headline:** "20-30 Hours From Broken to Fixed"

The Loop (visual diagram):
```
Operator Uses Agent
       ↓
Flags What's Wrong
       ↓
Structured Issue Created
       ↓
Agentic Dev Proposes Fix
       ↓
Human Approves
       ↓
Improved Agent Live
       ↓
[Loop repeats]
```

**Key stat:** Every cycle logged as performance data

**Punchline:** "Operators train agents, not prompts."

**Purpose:** This is your differentiation. The "holy shit" is the speed.

---

### SLIDE 6: DIRECTOR AI
**What you say:**
"All of this feeds into Director AI—the enterprise agent brain. It sits on top of WhatsApp, Excel, ERPs, all the tools. It does three things: Maps the company's process and data graph from our archeology. Orchestrates human and AI agents across workflows. And benchmarks performance against internal history and eventually cross-company patterns."

**On screen:**
**Headline:** "Director AI: The Enterprise Agent Brain"

Visual: Director AI in center, connected to:
- Left: Tools (WhatsApp, Excel, ERP, PowerBI)
- Right: Agents (logistics, finance, ops, marketing)

Three capabilities:
1. **Map** — Build process + data graph
2. **Orchestrate** — Coordinate human + AI agents
3. **Benchmark** — Compare performance across patterns

**Purpose:** Put a clear product object in investor's mind.

---

### SLIDE 7: THE VISION & THE MOAT
**What you say:**
"Where does this go? Phase one, we're deep inside complex enterprises—family offices with multiple business models. We build workflows for Marriott, Burger King, construction, finance. Phase two, we replicate vertically—Opera PMS workflows we built for Marriott become plug-and-play for other hotels. Same for F&B systems, construction workflows, finance automation. Phase three, we connect them. Their anonymized performance data becomes cross-company benchmarks. Companies see how they compare to peers. Vendors get proof of performance, not just promises. And we can route work—and eventually capital—to the best performers. This creates our moat: industry-specific playbooks that replicate vertically, proprietary benchmark data, switching costs through Director AI, and network effects as more companies join the network."

**On screen:**
**Headline:** "From One Family Office to LatAm's Agent Marketplace"

Three-step visual:
1. Deploy in one family office (3+ business models) → instrument everything
2. Replicate vertically (Opera PMS → other hotels, F&B systems → other restaurants)
3. Connect: benchmarks → routing → capital

**The Moat (What Makes Us Defensible):**
1. **Vertical Replication** — Workflows built once, replicated across industries (Opera PMS → hotels, F&B systems → restaurants)
2. **Proprietary Data** — Cross-company benchmarks ("Your process takes 4 hours; industry average is 45 minutes")
3. **Switching Costs** — Director AI becomes the brain (replacing it is painful)
4. **Network Effects** — More companies = better benchmarks = more value

**Industry Playbooks:**
- Hospitality (Marriott → other hotels)
- F&B (Burger King → other restaurants)
- Construction (Bolivia's biggest → other builders)
- Finance (Investment bank → other banks)

What this unlocks:
- Companies: "How do I compare to peers?"
- Vendors: "Proof of performance, not promises"
- Platform: "Route work and capital to best performers"

**Purpose:** Show the big, inevitable end-state + vertical replication moat.

---

### SLIDE 8: BUSINESS MODEL (Trojan Horse Strategy)
**What you say:**
"How do we make money? We use workflows as the Trojan Horse. Phase one: High-value workflow automation projects—$90K average deal, 34% gross margin. This proves ROI and funds infrastructure build. Phase two: Director AI infrastructure—$8,500 setup, $20/user/month, 85% gross margin. 30-40% of workflow clients adopt infrastructure within 12 months. Phase three: Platform economics—as infrastructure mix grows, blended margin expands from 34% to 67% at full capacity. Workflows fund the platform. Infrastructure creates leverage."

**On screen:**
**Headline:** "Workflows Fund Infrastructure, Infrastructure Creates Leverage"

| | WORKFLOWS | INFRASTRUCTURE | BLENDED |
|---|-----------|----------------|---------|
| **Revenue** | $90K/client/year | $20/user/month | Weighted avg |
| **Margin** | 34% (3 clients) → 67% (6 clients) | 85% | 34% → 67% |
| **Purpose** | Prove ROI, fund R&D | Platform leverage | Margin expansion |
| **Timeline** | Month 0-12 (85% of revenue) | Month 12-24 (30% of revenue) | Month 24-36 (60% infra) |

**The Flywheel:**
1. Workflows prove value → 30-40% convert to infrastructure
2. Infrastructure creates recurring revenue → 85% margin
3. Blended margin expands → 34% → 67% at scale

**Key Metric:** We reinvest 30-40% of workflow revenue into infrastructure R&D. Workflows fund the platform, not capital.

**Purpose:** Show Trojan Horse strategy with margin expansion story.

---

### SLIDE 9: WHY NOW
**What you say:**
"Why is this the moment? Three forces colliding. First, AI anxiety—every CEO in LatAm is being asked 'what's your AI strategy?' but their reality is WhatsApp and Excel. Second, global tools don't fit—consultants don't understand agentic workflows, AI vendors assume clean data. Third, trade-driven growth needs operational truth—capital wants to fund LatAm but flies blind on operational risk. We sit exactly at this intersection."

**On screen:**
**Headline:** "The Moment Before Agent Rails Exist"

Three forces:
1. **AI anxiety in boardrooms** — "What's your AI strategy?" meets WhatsApp reality
2. **Global tools don't fit** — Consultants don't get agents, vendors assume clean data
3. **Trade growth needs truth** — Capital flies blind on operational risk

**Punchline:** "Someone builds LatAm's agent rails in 3-5 years. We're starting where it works."

**Purpose:** Answer "why doesn't this already exist?"

---

### SLIDE 10: TRACTION & UNIT ECONOMICS
**What you say:**
"Here's proof this works. One enterprise client—a family office with 3+ business models: Marriott franchise, Burger King franchise, Bolivia's biggest construction company, and an investment bank. Deep signals across all businesses. 68 interviews processed in 2 weeks. 2,700+ internal datapoints linked into an enterprise graph. 292 automation opportunities identified. $270K confirmed revenue. $1.5M potential value identified. And we ship fast—7 products in 5 months. Our unit economics prove the model: $90K average deal per business model, 34% gross margin at current capacity, scaling to 67% at full capacity. The beauty: we're building relationships with complex enterprises. Once we build workflows for one business model, we can replicate vertically—Opera PMS for Marriott becomes plug-and-play for other hotels."

**On screen:**
**Headline:** "One Family Office, 3+ Business Models, Vertical Replication"

**First Client (Family Office):**
- Marriott franchise (hospitality)
- Burger King franchise (F&B)
- Biggest construction company in Bolivia (construction)
- Investment bank (finance)

Big metrics (rule of three):
- **$270K** — Confirmed Revenue (1 family office, 3+ business models)
- **34% → 67%** — Gross Margin (scales with capacity)
- **$1.5M** — Potential Value Identified

Unit economics:
- $90K average deal per business model
- 34% GM at current capacity → 67% GM at full capacity
- Capacity: 2 founders = 6 clients max ($540K revenue potential)

**The Replication Play:**
- Opera PMS workflows (Marriott) → plug-and-play for other hotels
- F&B systems (Burger King) → other restaurants
- Construction workflows → other builders
- Finance automation → other banks

Supporting:
- 68 interviews, 2,700+ datapoints linked
- 292 opportunities identified
- 7 products shipped in 5 months

**Purpose:** Prove methodology + vertical replication strategy + unit economics.

---

### SLIDE 11: UNIT ECONOMICS & MARGIN EXPANSION
**What you say:**
"Our economics prove the model scales. At 3 clients, we're at 34% gross margin—$90K per client, founder time allocated across clients. At full capacity with 6 clients, we hit 67% gross margin—same founder time, more revenue. The margin expansion comes from two places: infrastructure mix grows from 0% to 30% of revenue, and workflow delivery leverage improves as we templatize. We reinvest 30-40% of workflow revenue into infrastructure R&D—workflows fund the platform. This is the Trojan Horse strategy: services prove value, infrastructure creates leverage."

**On screen:**
**Headline:** "Margin Expansion Through Scale & Infrastructure"

**Capacity Model:**
| Scenario | Clients | Business Models | Revenue | GM % | Key Driver |
|----------|---------|-----------------|---------|------|------------|
| Current | 1 (family office) | 3+ | $270K | 34% | Solo founder + 2-3h co-founder |
| Full Capacity | 6 | 18+ | $540K | 67% | 2 founders full-time |

**Margin Expansion Timeline:**
- Month 0-12: 34% blended GM (workflow-heavy, 85% of revenue)
- Month 12-24: 52% blended GM (infrastructure attach, 30% of revenue)
- Month 24-36: 68% blended GM (infrastructure-led, 60% of revenue)

**The Flywheel:**
1. Workflows prove ROI → 30-40% convert to infrastructure
2. Infrastructure creates recurring → 85% margin
3. Blended margin expands → 34% → 67% at scale

**Key Metric:** 30-40% of workflow revenue reinvested into infrastructure R&D

**Purpose:** Prove unit economics scale and margin expansion story.

### SLIDE 12: SHIPPING VELOCITY
**What you say:**
"We don't just diagnose—we ship. In 5 months, we went from starting ops to WhatsApp interviews, entity extractor, automation platform, custom service desk, AI financial workflows, AI marketing workflows. Seven products. This is what AI-native operators look like."

**On screen:**
**Headline:** "7 Products in 5 Months"

Timeline (Sep 2025 → Jan 2026):
- Sep: Started Ops

## Financial Model Highlights (For Investor Q&A)

**Unit Economics:**
- Per-business model: $90K revenue, $59,400 COGS = 34% GM (current capacity)
- Current: 1 family office with 3+ business models = $270K revenue
- At full capacity (6 clients, 18+ business models): $90K per business model, $29,700 COGS = 67% GM
- Scale effect: Founder time allocated across more clients = higher GM
- Vertical replication: Workflows built once, replicated across industries (Opera PMS for Marriott → plug-and-play for other hotels)

**Capacity Model:**
- Current: Solo founder + 2-3h co-founder = 1 family office (3+ business models) = $270K, 34% GM
- Full capacity: 2 founders full-time = 6 clients (18+ business models) = $540K, 67% GM
- Bottleneck: Co-founder needs to go full-time to unlock scale
- Vertical replication: Workflows built for one business model (e.g., Opera PMS for Marriott) become plug-and-play for other hotels

**Margin Expansion:**
- Month 0-12: 34% blended GM (workflow-heavy)
- Month 12-24: 52% blended GM (infrastructure attach begins)
- Month 24-36: 68% blended GM (infrastructure-led)

**Stress Tests:**
- All 6 scenarios pass (business survives capacity constraints, client churn, cost increases)
- Key risk: Capacity constraint limits growth (solved by co-founder full-time)

**The Trojan Horse:**
- Workflows prove ROI → 30-40% convert to infrastructure
- Infrastructure creates recurring revenue → 85% margin
- We reinvest 30-40% of workflow revenue into infrastructure R&D
- Workflows fund the platform, not capital

**Vertical Replication Strategy (The Moat):**
- Build workflows for one business model (e.g., Opera PMS for Marriott)
- Replicate vertically across industries (Opera PMS → other hotels)
- Industry playbooks: Hospitality (Marriott), F&B (Burger King), Construction (Bolivia's biggest), Finance (Investment bank)
- Moat: Workflows built once, reused across enterprises = leverage

**Vertical Replication Strategy:**
- Build workflows for one business model (e.g., Opera PMS for Marriott)
- Replicate vertically across industries (Opera PMS → other hotels)
- Industry playbooks: Hospitality, F&B, Construction, Finance
- Moat: Workflows built once, reused across enterprises
