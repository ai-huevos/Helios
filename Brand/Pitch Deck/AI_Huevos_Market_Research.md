## Investment Thesis Summary

### The Opportunity

**Market:** USD 300M–1B SAM for diagnostic-led AI automation in LatAm  
**Problem:** LatAm family offices / multi-business groups face 2–3x slower operational close cycles + 2–3x higher overhead  
**Timing:** AI readiness, labor cost curves, regulatory pressure, post-pandemic budget = favorable  
**Proof Points:** Petrobras, Nubank, Coca-Cola FEMSA AI successes + FundCount/local RPA boutiques validate model  

### The Model

**Entry:** USD 30–50K diagnostic (4–6 weeks)  
**Implementation:** USD 50–90K per business unit (8–12 weeks)  
**Retention:** USD 2–10K/month managed services (18+ months)  
**Conversion:** 40–65% diagnostic → implementation, 70–85% managed services retention  
**ACV:** USD 85–150K (Year 1–2); USD 120–250K+ (Year 2+)  

### The Unit Economics

**Margins:** 40% (Y1) → 55% (Y2) → 70% (Y3)  
**Break-even:** 8–12 customers, 12–18 months  
**LTV:CAC:** 3.8x (Y1) → 10x (Y2) → 25x (Y3) = healthy  
**3-Year Revenue Potential:** USD 2–4M  

### The Defensibility

**Competitive Moat:**
- AI-native diagnostics (vs. template RPA)
- Vertical playbooks (Hospitality, F&B, Real Estate, Construction)
- Trojan horse model (diagnostic entry → managed services stickiness)
- Lower price point (USD 40K entry vs. USD 300K consulting minimums)

**Direct Competitors:** Local RPA boutiques (but you have AI advantage + verticalization)  
**Indirect Competitors:** Big 4 consulting (but high minimums), Software factories (but low strategic value)  
**Threat Assessment:** High threat from boutiques, mitigable with vertical focus + brand building  

### The Risks (All Mitigable)

1. ✓ Change management failure → Embed in diagnostic; assign champion
2. ✓ Scope creep → Fixed-price, phased delivery; change orders
3. ✓ Customer concentration → Vertical + geographic diversification
4. ✓ Pricing pressure → Vertical IP + managed services moat
5. ✓ Longer sales cycle → PoC model, executive engagement

**No deal-breaker risks.** All addressable with disciplined execution.

### The Path to Seed Capital

**H1 2026:** Close 2–3 pilots, build 1–2 case studies  
**Q3 2026:** Raise USD 150–250K seed capital with validated model  
**2027:** Scale to 8–12 customers, USD 800K–1.2M revenue run-rate, 50%+ margins  
**2028+:** Path to Series A or profitability
