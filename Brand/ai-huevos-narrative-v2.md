# AI HUEVOS
## The way your organization works was built for a world that no longer exists.

---

## WHAT WE DO (One Sentence)

**We interview your people, find what's broken, fix it with technology, and stay to keep improving.**

Think of us like hiring a new operations director—but one who actually talks to everyone, finds the real problems, and fixes them. Not with more meetings. With technology that works.

---

## THE PROBLEM

### Every big company runs on three invisible systems:
1. **WhatsApp** – where the real decisions happen
2. **Excel** – where the real data lives
3. **People's heads** – where the real knowledge is trapped

You've spent millions on SAP, Oracle, fancy software. Your people use maybe 20% of it.

Meanwhile:
- Your best employee quits → chaos
- You need a report → 3 days of Excel work
- You want to know what's really happening → nobody can tell you

**Everyone's talking about AI. Nobody's talking about the fact that AI can't help if your company's reality lives in WhatsApp groups and Excel files.**

---

## WHAT WE BUILD

### We build rails.

Think about railroads. Before trains, every town was an island. Rails connected them.

Your company is the same:
- SAP is one island
- Excel is another
- WhatsApp is another
- Each department is another

**We build the rails so information can flow. So AI can actually work. So you can see what's happening.**

## HOW IT WORKS (Simple, Linear)

| Step | What Happens | Time |
|------|--------------|------|
| **1. We talk** | Interview your team. Find what's broken. | 2-4 weeks |
| **2. We fix** | Build automations that do the boring work. | 2-8 weeks |
| **3. We improve** | Your people give feedback. We make it smarter. | Ongoing |
| **4. We stay** | Director AI keeps everything connected. | Monthly |

### What does "we fix" actually mean?

**Before:** Your team spends 3 days building a monthly report.
**After:** It takes 15 minutes.

**Before:** Contract creation takes 47 steps and 2 weeks.
**After:** 5 steps, same day.

**Before:** New employee takes 6 months to understand the company.
**After:** They ask Director AI and get answers immediately.

## WHAT WE'VE DONE

### Grupo Doria Medina (Bolivia)
A family office with hotels, restaurants, construction, and Burger King franchises.

| What We Did | Result |
|-------------|--------|
| Interviewed 68 people | Found $15M in savings opportunities |
| Built automation for contracts | 250 contracts/day, automated |
| Created company map | Leadership finally sees what's happening |
| Identified bottlenecks | Know exactly where to fix next |

**Contract value:** $94K

### Finkargo (Colombia)
We helped build this company from early stage to:
- 550 importers served
- $650M in merchandise managed
- 110+ processes automated
- Trade finance at scale in Latin America

**We know what makes companies work. We built it.**

---

## THREE PRODUCTS

### 1. The Checkup ($5-15K)
Like going to the doctor. We interview everyone, look at all your systems, and give you a complete picture.

**You get:**
- Map of who does what (the real one, not the org chart)
- List of systems and how much they're actually used
- Where money is being wasted
- Priority list: what to fix first

### 2. The Fix ($15-50K per automation)
We build tools that do the boring work.

**You get:**
- Working automation in 2-3 weeks
- Your people give feedback, we improve it
- Every automation gets smarter over time

### 3. Director AI ($10-20/user/month)
Your company's brain. Everything in one place.

**You get:**
- All company knowledge accessible
- Ask questions, get real answers
- See problems before they become crises
- New employees learn 10x faster

---

## WHY THEY STAY

This is the question everyone asks: "How is this different from hiring a consulting firm or a software shop?"

| Consulting Firms | Software Shops | AI Huevos |
|------------------|----------------|-----------|
| Diagnose | Build | Both |
| Leave PowerPoints | Build and leave | Stay and improve |
| Call them for advice | Call them if it breaks | We see it break first |
| Knowledge leaves with them | Code sits unused | Director AI keeps everything |

**Our retention model:**
- The Checkup brings us in
- The Fix shows value fast
- Director AI keeps us there

Every month, the system gets smarter. Replacing us means losing the brain.

We interview everyone. We find what's broken. We fix it. We stay.

**The way your organization works was built for a world that no longer exists.**

Let us help you build for the one that's coming.
