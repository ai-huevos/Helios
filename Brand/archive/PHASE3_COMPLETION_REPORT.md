- **Bilingual Format:** Brand book uses bilingual format (separate English and Spanish sections) rather than Spanish-only, as it serves as technical documentation for both internal and external use
- **Glossary Location:** `Brand/brand/brand-book/08-terminology-glossary.md` - Reference this file when creating new content or updating existing files
