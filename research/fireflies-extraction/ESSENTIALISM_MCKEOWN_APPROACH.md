## The Essentialist's Approach

### Step 1: EXPLORE - Discern the Vital Few from the Trivial Many

**Question**: "What is the minimum viable information needed for the AI Co-CEO agent to make optimal decisions?"

**Criteria for "Essential":**
- ✅ Directly informs a decision or action
- ✅ Appears in decision-making workflows
- ✅ Unique insight not found elsewhere
- ✅ Quantifiable or pattern-based (not anecdotal)
- ✅ Used in multiple contexts (high leverage)

**Criteria for "Non-Essential":**
- ❌ Historical context that doesn't inform future decisions
- ❌ Redundant examples (keep only the best 1-2)
- ❌ Verbose quotes when summary captures insight
- ❌ Meeting IDs and metadata (unless critical for traceability)
- ❌ Duplicate information across files

---

### Step 2: ELIMINATE - Cut Out the Nonessential

**Elimination Strategy:**

1. **Remove the Obvious Non-Essentials First**
   - Placeholder text ("To be extracted", "Additional meetings")
   - Redundant meeting IDs (keep one key example)
   - Full quotes when summary suffices
   - Verbose metadata that doesn't inform decisions

2. **Consolidate Duplicates**
   - If same insight appears in 3 places, keep it in the most logical location
   - Cross-reference instead of duplicating
   - Remove redundant examples (keep best 1-2)

3. **Simplify Structure**
   - Remove nested hierarchies that don't add clarity
   - Consolidate similar sections
   - Use tables/lists instead of verbose prose

### Step 3: EXECUTE - Remove Obstacles, Make Execution Effortless

**Context Engineering Principles:**

1. **Hierarchical Information Architecture**
   - Most important insights at top
   - Supporting details below
   - Patterns before examples

2. **Explicit Relationships**
   - Clear cross-references
   - Pattern → Example → Action format
   - Decision criteria clearly stated

3. **Reduced Cognitive Load**
   - One insight per section
   - Bullet points over paragraphs
   - Quantifiable metrics highlighted

4. **Action-Oriented Structure**
   - "When X, do Y" format
   - Decision frameworks before examples
   - Patterns that enable prediction

## Essentialism Questions for Each File

### For Every Section, Ask:

1. **"If I could only keep 20% of this, what would it be?"**
   - Forces prioritization
   - Identifies truly essential content

2. **"Does this inform a decision or action?"**
   - If no → eliminate
   - If yes → keep, but simplify

3. **"Is this the best example of this pattern?"**
   - If no → replace with better example
   - If yes → keep, remove others

4. **"Could an AI agent reason about this without this detail?"**
   - If yes → eliminate detail
   - If no → keep, but make it explicit

5. **"Does this appear elsewhere?"**
   - If yes → consolidate to one location
   - If no → keep, but ensure it's in right place

## Context Engineering Optimizations

### For AI Reasoning:

1. **Pattern-First Structure**
   - State pattern → Give best example → Show application
   - Enables pattern matching and generalization

2. **Explicit Decision Criteria**
   - "When X condition, use Y approach"
   - Quantifiable thresholds ($26K/year)
   - Clear if/then logic

3. **Minimal Context, Maximum Signal**
   - Remove historical context unless it informs future
   - Keep only actionable insights
   - Focus on "what works" not "what happened"

4. **Structured for Retrieval**
   - Clear headings enable semantic search
   - Key terms highlighted
   - Relationships explicit

## Application Strategy

### Phase 1: Explore (Identify Essential)
- Review each file
- Mark sections as: Essential / Supporting / Eliminate
- Identify patterns vs. examples

### Phase 2: Eliminate (Cut Nonessential)
- Remove marked sections
- Consolidate duplicates
- Simplify structure

### Phase 3: Execute (Optimize for AI)
- Restructure for pattern-first
- Make decision criteria explicit
- Reduce cognitive load
