# Essentialism Results (McKeown Approach)

**Date**: 2026-01-15  
**Method**: Greg McKeown Essentialism + Context Engineering  
**Status**: ✅ Insights Complete | ⏳ Artifacts In Progress

---

## Essentialism Philosophy Applied

**"The disciplined pursuit of less but better"**

### Three-Step Process:
1. **EXPLORE** - Discerned vital few from trivial many
2. **ELIMINATE** - Cut out nonessential
3. **EXECUTE** - Optimized for AI reasoning and decision-making

## Results: Insights Files

| File | Before | After | Reduction | Status |
|------|--------|-------|-----------|--------|
| `gtm_intelligence.md` | 412 lines | ~150 lines | 63% | ✅ |
| `customer_insights.md` | 358 lines | ~120 lines | 66% | ✅ |
| `strategic_insights.md` | 296 lines | ~90 lines | 70% | ✅ |
| **Total Insights** | **1,066 lines** | **~360 lines** | **66%** | ✅ |

## What Was Eliminated

### Non-Essential Removed:
- ❌ Meeting IDs (unless critical for traceability)
- ❌ Verbose quotes (kept summaries)
- ❌ Redundant examples (kept best 1-2)
- ❌ Placeholder text ("To be extracted", "Additional meetings")
- ❌ Duplicate information across sections
- ❌ Verbose "Why it works" explanations
- ❌ Historical context that doesn't inform decisions

### Essential Kept:
- ✅ Decision patterns and frameworks
- ✅ Quantifiable thresholds ($26K/year)
- ✅ Win/loss patterns
- ✅ Customer qualification criteria
- ✅ Key learnings (Vistage failure patterns)
- ✅ Partner collaboration principles
- ✅ Strategic recommendations

## Context Engineering Optimizations

### For AI Reasoning:

1. **Pattern-First Structure**
   - Patterns stated before examples
   - Enables pattern matching and generalization

2. **Explicit Decision Criteria**
   - Quantifiable thresholds highlighted
   - Clear if/then logic
   - Decision tables where applicable

3. **Hierarchical Information**
   - Most important insights at top
   - Supporting details below
   - Reduced cognitive load

4. **Structured for Retrieval**
   - Clear headings enable semantic search
   - Key terms highlighted
   - Relationships explicit

## Key Improvements

### Before Essentialism:
- Verbose meeting quotes
- Multiple examples of same pattern
- Redundant cross-references
- Historical context mixed with actionable insights
- Meeting IDs cluttering examples

### After Essentialism:
- Concise pattern statements
- Best 1-2 examples per pattern
- Clear cross-references
- Only actionable insights
- Clean, scannable structure
