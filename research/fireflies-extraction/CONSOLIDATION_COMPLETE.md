## Next Steps (Essentialism Phase)

### To Apply Essentialism:
1. ⏳ Review each file for redundancy
2. ⏳ Remove over-detailed examples (keep 2-3 best)
3. ⏳ Consolidate cross-references
4. ⏳ Remove historical context that's no longer relevant
5. ⏳ Keep only actionable insights

### Essentialism Principles:
- Keep only actionable insights
- Remove redundant examples
- Consolidate cross-references
- Maintain clear structure
- Remove historical context that's no longer relevant

## Workflow for Future Updates

### When Updating Documents:
1. **Edit the main file directly** (no v2 suffix)
2. **Version control** through git commits
3. **Document changes** in file header (Last Updated date)
4. **Cross-reference** related files if needed

### When Major Corrections Needed:
1. **Create backup** (git branch or archive folder)
2. **Update main file** with corrections
3. **Update version number** in file header if significant change
4. **Document what changed** in file header or CHANGELOG
