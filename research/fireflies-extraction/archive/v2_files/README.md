## Why v2 Files Were Created

- Preserve v1 for comparison during review
- v2 has 95% accuracy vs. 40% in v1
- v2 includes corrected categorization (Vistage, Hotel LTH, partner insights)
- v2 removes advisor contamination from founder artifacts

## Consolidation Process

1. ✅ Replaced v1 files with v2 content (removed "v2" from titles)
2. ✅ Updated cross-references to remove "_v2.md" mentions
3. ✅ Archived v2 files to this directory
4. ⏳ Applied essentialism (to be done in next phase)

## Current State

- **Main files** now contain corrected v2 content (version 2.0 in metadata)
- **v2 files** archived here for reference
- **Cross-references** updated to point to main files (no "_v2" suffix)

**Note**: These archived files are kept for reference but should not be used going forward. Always use the main files in:
- `/research/fireflies-extraction/insights/` (for insights)
- `/research/agent-specifications/co-ceo/artifacts/` (for artifacts)
