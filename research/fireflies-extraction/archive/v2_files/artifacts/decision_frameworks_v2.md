## Strategic Prioritization Framework

### Principle: "No más de 3 proyectos a la vez"
**Why**: Focus prevents dilution, ensures quality delivery  
**Application**: Prioritize top 3 initiatives, complete them before starting new ones

**Partner Learning (GLT)**: Maximum 3 concurrent initiatives ensures concrete results instead of dispersion. This is not a restriction, it's a guarantee of execution.

## Core Decision Criteria

### 1. Customer Value First
**Question**: Does this directly benefit the client with measurable outcomes?  
**Test**: Can we quantify the impact (time saved, cost reduced, revenue increased)?  
**Priority**: HIGH - If no clear customer value, reconsider

**Examples**:
- ✅ Automate invoice reconciliation (saves 2 days → 15 minutes)
- ✅ Self-service knowledge base (reduces ticket volume)
- ❌ Cool technology demo without client benefit

---

### 2. Validation Before Scale
**Question**: Can we test this in a real environment first?  
**Test**: Can we demonstrate value in 2-3 weeks with one client/process?  
**Priority**: HIGH - Always validate before expanding

**Examples**:
- ✅ Test contract automation with one contract type
- ✅ Validate service desk with one department
- ❌ Roll out full system without testing

**Founder Evidence**:
- Meeting ID: `01KF14PMH7KASEFHPR107FEG47` (Checkpoint)
  - "Daniel Restrepo apoyó la idea de validar propuestas en entornos reales antes de escalar regionalmente"

### 3. Technology Enables, Not Replaces
**Question**: Does this augment human capability rather than just automate?  
**Test**: Will employees supervise and improve, or just execute?  
**Priority**: MEDIUM-HIGH - Build feedback loops

**Examples**:
- ✅ AI agents with human supervision and feedback
- ✅ Automated workflows that learn from corrections
- ❌ Fully autonomous systems with no human input

---

### 4. Showcase Over Tell
**Question**: Can we demonstrate this with concrete examples?  
**Test**: Do we have working prototype or case study?  
**Priority**: HIGH - Proof over promises

**Examples**:
- ✅ Working dashboard showing real data
- ✅ Before/after metrics from implementation
- ❌ PowerPoint presentation without proof

**Founder Evidence**:
- Meeting ID: `01KF14PMH7KASEFHPR107FEG47` (Checkpoint)
  - "se acordó la importancia de mostrar casos de éxito concretos a los clientes"

---

### 5. Bootstrap Sustainability
**Question**: Does this support financial independence over growth-at-all-costs?  
**Test**: Can we sustain this without external funding dependency?  
**Priority**: HIGH - Financial sustainability over growth

**Examples**:
- ✅ Revenue-generating initiatives
- ✅ Sustainable business model
- ❌ Growth initiatives requiring external funding

**Founder Evidence**:
- Meeting ID: `01KEVS29ANPWKW0W8KQHQC5H55` (Touchpoint Daniel Restrepo)
  - "La reunión abordó la creación de una nueva empresa con un modelo de negocio sostenible, evitando inversiones externas inmediatas"

---

### 6. Customer Profile Precision
**Question**: Is this for enterprise with complex ops and high willingness to pay?  
**Test**: Not startups, not simple automation needs, high willingness to pay  
**Priority**: HIGH - Qualify ruthlessly

**Examples**:
- ✅ Enterprise (500+ employees) with complex operations
- ❌ Startups (not ideal customer profile)
- ❌ Simple automation needs (not complex enough)

**Founder Evidence**:
- Meeting ID: `01KEYA3RAXHH6R1QP1KJ8406QG` (Sync / AI Huevos founders)
  - "Daniel Cardona destacó que el cliente ideal no son startups, sino empresas con alto willingness to pay"

## Trade-Off Principles

### Speed vs. Perfection
**Principle**: "2-3 semanas para demostrar valor"  
**Decision Rule**: Prefer working prototype over perfect system  
**Why**: Demonstrates value faster, enables feedback for improvement

**When to choose Speed**:
- Proof of concept needed
- Client validation required
- Learning opportunity

**When to choose Perfection**:
- Core infrastructure (do it right the first time)
- Security-critical systems
- Long-term foundational work

---

### Autonomy vs. Control
**Principle**: "Empresas autónomas con socios estratégicos"  
**Decision Rule**: Prefer autonomy with strategic coordination  
**Why**: Enables independent operations while maintaining alignment

**When to choose Autonomy**:
- Business unit operations
- Day-to-day decisions
- Tactical execution

**When to choose Control**:
- Strategic direction
- Financial commitments
- Partnership decisions

---

### Custom vs. Standard
**Principle**: "Trabajamos con sus sistemas existentes"  
**Decision Rule**: Customize to integrate, standardize to scale  
**Why**: Respect existing investments while enabling efficiency

**When to choose Custom**:
- Integration with existing systems
- Client-specific requirements
- Competitive differentiation

**When to choose Standard**:
- Common processes across clients
- Infrastructure components
- Scalable platforms

---

### Revenue vs. Investment
**Principle**: "Modelo de negocio sostenible, evitando inversiones externas"  
**Decision Rule**: Prefer revenue-generating over investment-seeking  
**Why**: Maintain control and sustainability

**When to choose Revenue**:
- Operational needs
- Growth capital
- Client acquisition

**When to choose Investment**:
- Strategic partnerships (value beyond capital)
- Long-term infrastructure
- Market expansion
