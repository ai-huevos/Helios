### Vistage Colombia
**Profile**: Churned client (not ideal customer profile, but valuable failure pattern learnings)

**Context**:
- Was a paying customer with active project execution (400 leads generated, $2,150 pipeline)
- Relationship had issues and eventually churned
- NOT ideal customer profile (ICP) - provides valuable failure pattern learnings

**Jobs To Be Done** (What They Needed):
1. Execute content strategy (70 contents planned, only 8 published)
2. Follow up on generated leads (400 qualified leads, but database management issues)
3. Control financial service usage (WhatsApp, email costs)
4. Improve internal control and database management

**Pain Points**:
- **Content Execution Gap**: Strategy generated 400 qualified leads, but only 8 of 70 planned contents published, affecting opportunity closure
- **Follow-up & Control Issues**: Database management problems limited sales funnel progression
- **Financial Control**: Pending costs ($1,500), service usage control challenges
- **Not Ideal Customer Profile**: Not enterprise, complex ops, high willingness to pay

**Pain Intensity**: HIGH (Relationship Issues)
- Execution capability gaps
- Follow-up infrastructure problems
- Financial control issues
- Not ideal customer profile match

**Failure Patterns (What Went Wrong)**:
1. **Content Execution Failure**: Only 8 of 70 planned contents published despite 400 qualified leads generated
2. **Follow-up Infrastructure Gaps**: Database management issues limited sales funnel progression
3. **Financial Control Issues**: Pending costs, service usage control challenges
4. **Not Ideal Customer Profile**: Not enterprise, complex ops, high willingness to pay

**What Was Delivered (Success)**:
- Lead generation system (18 new members/month target, $181 CAC, 200-300 leads/month projected, 30-40% conversion to SQL and demos)
- Email marketing campaign (3,700 emails sent, 40% open rate, 460 clicks)
- Lead scoring system and content strategy (70 contents planned, emotional leadership narrative for LatAm CEOs)

**Key Learnings**:
- Strategy without execution capability = failure
- Lead generation without follow-up system = wasted investment
- Financial transparency and control critical for client relationships
- Qualification criteria must be stricter - enterprise, complex ops, high willingness to pay
