## GLT as Peer Example (Not Competitor)

**Context**: GLT is a partner that implemented AI processes internally (NOT implemented by AI Huevos). These meetings show what GLT learned from their own experience, offering valuable peer learning insights.

### GLT's Approach (Peer Learning):
- **Data enrichment before automation**: Enrich internal data BEFORE automating to personalize follow-up
- **Maximum 3 concurrent initiatives**: Limiting to 3 ensures concrete results
- **Account growth focus**: Growing existing accounts in addition to acquiring new ones
- **System integration for adoption**: CRM + Power BI integration enables sales team access
- **Lead magnets as brief diagnostics**: Brief diagnostics work as lead magnets

### How AI Huevos Differs:
- **We implement for clients** (GLT implemented for themselves)
- **We provide diagnostic-first approach** (GLT learned this through experience)
- **We specialize in enterprise automation** (GLT is broader business)
- **We use agentic AI development** (small team, high leverage)

### Learning from GLT:
- Data enrichment is prerequisite for effective automation
- Limiting to 3 initiatives is not restriction, it's guarantee of execution
- Integration between systems (Power BI, CRM) is critical for adoption
- Brief diagnostics work as lead magnets and validate hypotheses
