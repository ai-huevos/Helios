## Objection Handling Patterns

### "Caro" / "Costo" (Too Expensive)
**Response Pattern:**
- Lead with diagnostic (identify $1.5M+ value potential before commitment)
- Show ROI before asking for investment
- Start small (2-3 weeks pilot) before full engagement
- Use $26K/year automation threshold to justify investment

**Key Message:** "Diagnostic identifies $1.5M+ potential. If we don't see $500K+ value, we don't proceed. Takes 2 weeks, no commitment."

---

## Messaging That Works

**Primary Value Proposition:**
"Diagnosticamos y solucionamos ineficiencias operativas en grandes empresas de Latinoamérica mediante automatización inteligente que genera resultados medibles."

**Key Elements:**
- Quantifies results ($134K confirmed, $1.5M potential)
- Shows speed (7 products in <5 months)
- Diagnostic-first approach
- Client retention focus

## Partner Collaboration Principles

### What Works

1. **Weekly Syncs Non-Negotiable**
   - Structured communication prevents misalignment
   - Apply to all partner relationships

2. **Maximum 3 Concurrent Initiatives**
   - Prevents dispersion, ensures execution
   - Apply to all engagements (customers and partners)

3. **Clear Role Division**
   - Strategy vs. implementation
   - Prevents overlap and confusion

4. **Financial Thresholds**
   - **$26K USD/year in losses justifies automation investment**
   - Use in diagnostic phase to qualify opportunities

5. **Simplification Before Automation**
   - Data enrichment BEFORE automation (GLT learning)
   - Consolidate systems before integrating (Atina: 3 SAP instances)
   - Simplify architecture before automating complexity

### What Doesn't Work

- Partner financial instability (derails projects)
- System fragmentation without consolidation plan
- Multiple concurrent projects without completion

---

## $26K/Year Automation Threshold

**Decision Rule:** If inefficiencies cost $26K+ USD/year, automation investment is justified.

**Application:**
- Use in diagnostic phase to qualify opportunities
- Start with 3 key processes (MVP), not full system automation
- Coordinate diagnostic with financial manager to validate priorities

---

## Customer Acquisition Patterns

### Success Patterns

1. **Showcase-Driven Sales** - Demonstrate value before asking for commitment
2. **Discovery Phase (44-Interview Diagnostic)** - Comprehensive discovery before solution
3. **Customer Qualification Criteria:**
   - Enterprise (500+ employees)
   - Complex operations (multiple systems)
   - High willingness to pay
   - Decision authority accessible
   - Execution capability required
4. **1-3 Week Delivery Cycles** - Quick wins demonstrate value
5. **MVP Approach (3 Initiatives Max)** - Focus prevents dispersion

### Failure Patterns (Vistage Learnings)

1. **Strategy Without Execution** - Execution capability required, not just strategy
2. **Lead Generation Without Follow-up** - Follow-up infrastructure critical
3. **Not Ideal Customer Profile** - Must qualify: enterprise, complex ops, high willingness to pay

---

## Decision Criteria (What Prospects Care About)

| Prospect Concern | Our Approach |
|------------------|--------------|
| ROI Visibility | Diagnostic shows $1.5M+ potential before commitment |
| Speed to Value | 2-3 weeks to working prototype |
| Risk Mitigation | Validate first, expand only if proven |
| Integration | Works with existing systems, doesn't replace |
| Proven Track Record | 7 products launched, $134K confirmed revenue |

---

## Win/Loss Patterns

### Win Patterns
- Clear, quantifiable pain point
- Decision authority accessible (one person can approve pilot)
- Urgency (affecting operations now)
- Openness to automation
- Execution capability (can implement recommendations)

### Loss Patterns
- Execution gap (strategy without execution capability)
- Follow-up infrastructure gaps
- Not ideal customer profile (not enterprise, complex ops, high willingness to pay)
- Financial control issues

## Competitive Differentiation

| Capability | AI Huevos | Typical Consultancies |
|------------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Speed** | 2-3 weeks to value | Months |
| **Output** | Working systems | Reports/recommendations |
| **Integration** | Works with existing | Often recommends replacement |
| **Demonstration** | Showcase prototypes | PowerPoint slides |
| **Model** | Bootstrap sustainable | VC-backed growth-at-all-costs |
| **Team** | Small, high leverage | Large teams |

**Key Learnings:** GLT peer insights (data enrichment first, 3-initiative limit), Sebastian Montoya contractor model (clear roles, weekly syncs), $26K threshold, Vistage failure patterns (qualify for execution capability).
