### Vistage Colombia (Failure Case - Learning)
**Context:** Paying customer (400 leads generated, $2,150 pipeline) that churned. NOT ideal customer profile, but provides valuable failure pattern learnings.

**What Was Delivered:**
- Lead generation system (18 new members/month target, $181 CAC, 200-300 leads/month, 30-40% conversion)
- Email marketing campaign (3,700 emails, 40% open rate, 460 clicks)
- Lead scoring system and content strategy (70 contents planned)

**Failure Patterns:**
1. **Content Execution Failure** - Only 8 of 70 planned contents published despite 400 qualified leads
2. **Follow-up Infrastructure Gaps** - Database management issues limited sales funnel progression
3. **Financial Control Issues** - Pending costs, service usage control challenges
4. **Not Ideal Customer Profile** - Not enterprise, complex ops, high willingness to pay

**Key Learnings:**
- Strategy without execution capability = failure
- Lead generation without follow-up system = wasted investment
- Financial transparency and control critical for client relationships
- Qualification criteria must be stricter: enterprise, complex ops, high willingness to pay, execution capability
