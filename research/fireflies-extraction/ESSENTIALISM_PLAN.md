# Essentialism Plan

**Date**: 2026-01-15  
**Objective**: Remove redundancy, keep only actionable insights, maintain clear structure

---

## Essentialism Principles

1. **Keep only actionable insights** - Remove theoretical or historical context that doesn't inform decisions
2. **Remove redundant examples** - Keep 2-3 best examples per pattern, remove duplicates
3. **Consolidate cross-references** - Simplify source references, remove verbose metadata
4. **Remove over-detailed quotes** - Keep key insights, remove full meeting quotes when summary suffices
5. **Eliminate duplicate information** - Remove content that appears in multiple files (consolidate to one source)

## Areas for Essentialism

### 1. Customer Insights
**Redundancies to Remove:**
- Multiple meeting IDs listed when one example suffices
- Full quotes when summary captures the insight
- "Additional meetings from category" placeholders
- Repetitive impact statements
- Cross-client patterns that duplicate individual customer sections

**Keep:**
- Key pain points per customer (1-2 most critical)
- Solution validation patterns (what worked)
- Failure patterns (Vistage learnings)
- Customer qualification criteria

### 2. GTM Intelligence
**Redundancies to Remove:**
- Multiple examples of same objection pattern
- Verbose "Why it works" explanations (keep concise)
- Duplicate partner learnings (already in partner_insights.md)
- Over-detailed meeting IDs in examples

**Keep:**
- Core objection handling responses
- Key partner collaboration principles
- $26K threshold and other quantifiable criteria
- Win/loss patterns

### 3. Strategic Insights
**Redundancies to Remove:**
- Detailed meeting quotes when summary suffices
- Repetitive strategic implications
- Cross-advisor themes that duplicate individual insights

**Keep:**
- Key advisor insights per advisor
- Strategic recommendations (synthesized)
- Cross-category strategic insights

### 4. Artifacts (All)
**Redundancies to Remove:**
- Verbose source references (simplify)
- Duplicate examples across artifacts
- Over-detailed meeting evidence (keep key quotes only)
- Repetitive "Implication" statements

**Keep:**
- Core values and principles
- Decision frameworks
- Key differentiators
- Actionable guidelines

## Essentialism Process

1. **Review each file** for redundancy
2. **Identify patterns** that appear multiple times
3. **Consolidate** to best examples (2-3 max)
4. **Remove** verbose quotes, keep summaries
5. **Simplify** cross-references and metadata
6. **Maintain** clear structure and actionable content

## Success Criteria

After essentialism:
- ✅ Files are 30-40% shorter
- ✅ No duplicate information across files
- ✅ Each insight appears once in best location
- ✅ Examples are concise (2-3 per pattern)
- ✅ Cross-references are simplified
- ✅ All content is actionable

**Status**: Ready to apply. Starting with one file as example, then proceeding with all files if approved.
