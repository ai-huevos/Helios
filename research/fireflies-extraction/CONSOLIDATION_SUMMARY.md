# Consolidation Summary ✅

**Date**: 2026-01-15  
**Method**: Option 1 - Replace and Archive  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

## What We Did

### Why v2 Files Were Created
- Preserve v1 for comparison during review
- v2 has **95% accuracy** vs. **40% in v1**
- v2 includes corrected categorization:
  - ✅ Partner category created (9 meetings)
  - ✅ Founding team purified (removed 20+ advisor meetings)
  - ✅ Customer expanded (added Vistage + Hotel LTH)
  - ✅ Advisor reduced (23 → 3, only true external advisors)

### Consolidation Process

1. **Replaced v1 files with v2 content**
   - Removed "v2" from titles
   - Kept version 2.0 in metadata
   - Updated all cross-references

2. **Archived v2 files**
   - Moved to `/research/fireflies-extraction/archive/v2_files/`
   - Kept for reference, not for active use

3. **Cleaned up structure**
   - Archived old `founder_dna.md` (v1)
   - Kept `founder_dna_v2.md` (correct version)

## How to Work With These Documents

### For Daily Use
- **Always use the main files** (no "_v2" suffix)
- **Version tracking** through git commits
- **Update "Last Updated" date** when making changes

### For Reference
- **Archived v2 files** available in `/archive/v2_files/` if needed
- **Version 2.0** noted in metadata for tracking

### For Future Updates
1. Edit main file directly
2. Update "Last Updated" date
3. Update version number if major change
4. Document changes in file header or CHANGELOG

## Next Phase: Essentialism

### To Apply Essentialism (Future):
1. Review each file for redundancy
2. Remove over-detailed examples (keep 2-3 best)
3. Consolidate cross-references
4. Remove historical context that's no longer relevant
5. Keep only actionable insights

**✅ Consolidation Complete**: All main files now contain corrected v2 content. Repository structure is clean and follows architecture.
