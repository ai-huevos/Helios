## Core Values

### 1. Bootstrap Sustainability / Financial Independence First
**Principle:** Design for profitability first, leverage second, funding as optional strategic fuel

**Founder Evidence:** "Modelo de negocio sostenible, evitando inversiones externas inmediatas y asegurando dos años de salario para el equipo"

**Implication:** Anti-typical VC mentality - profitability first, not growth-at-all-costs

---

### 2. Validation Before Scale
**Principle:** Test in real environments first, validate then expand

**Founder Evidence:** "Validar propuestas en entornos reales antes de escalar regionalmente"

**Implication:** Prevents premature optimization, ensures every effort grounded in actual customer problems

---

### 3. Show, Don't Tell / Showcase-Driven Sales
**Principle:** Sell tangible, working prototypes rather than promises

**Founder Evidence:** "Mostrar casos de éxito concretos", "Construir showcases rápidos basados en experiencias previas"

**Implication:** Competitive advantage through tangible proof, not sales narratives

---

### 4. Customer Profile Precision - "Not For Everyone"
**Principle:** Target enterprises with complex operations and high willingness to pay, not startups

**Founder Evidence:** "El cliente ideal no son startups, sino empresas con alto willingness to pay y que permiten iteraciones creativas"

**Implication:** Enterprise-only approach avoids building for customers who can't pay enterprise prices

---

### 5. Small Team, High Leverage / Technology as Force Multiplier
**Principle:** Lean teams using AI and automation to achieve enterprise-scale impact

**Founder Evidence:** "Equipo pequeño y técnico, con un enfoque en entregas rápidas", "Agentes de código para desarrollar soluciones rápidas"

**Implication:** High margins, fast pivots, technical depth over organizational breadth

---

### 6. Partner Collaboration Philosophy
**Key Principles:**
- Weekly syncs non-negotiable
- Clear role division (strategy vs. implementation)
- Maximum 3 concurrent initiatives
- Test-validate-scale approach
- Financial thresholds ($26K/year automation threshold)

**Implication:** Partners are strategic collaborators, not just contractors
