## GLT as Peer Example (Not Competitor)

**Context:** GLT implemented AI processes internally (NOT implemented by AI Huevos). Peer learning insights.

**GLT's Approach (Peer Learning):**
- Data enrichment before automation
- Maximum 3 concurrent initiatives
- Account growth focus (existing + new)
- System integration for adoption (CRM + Power BI)
- Lead magnets as brief diagnostics

**How AI Huevos Differs:**
- We implement for clients (GLT implemented for themselves)
- We provide diagnostic-first approach (GLT learned through experience)
- We specialize in enterprise automation (GLT is broader business)
- We use agentic AI development (small team, high leverage)

**Learning from GLT:**
- Data enrichment is prerequisite for effective automation
- Limiting to 3 initiatives is guarantee of execution, not restriction
- Integration between systems (Power BI, CRM) is critical for adoption
- Brief diagnostics work as lead magnets and validate hypotheses

## Bootstrap vs. VC-Backed Positioning

| Characteristic | VC-Backed Competitors | AI Huevos (Bootstrap) |
|----------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Mentality** | Growth-at-all-costs | Financial sustainability first |
| **Team** | Large teams and sales organizations | Small team, high leverage (agentic AI development) |
| **Expansion** | Aggressive expansion | Validation before scale |
| **Focus** | Scale over sustainability | Profitability over growth |
| **Market** | Broad market approach | Enterprise-only (not startups) |

**Strategic Position:** We're intelligent automation partners who integrate with existing systems to deliver measurable results quickly, building toward operating systems that make businesses more autonomous - all built sustainably (bootstrap-first), validated before scale, and demonstrated with tangible showcases rather than promises. **We are NOT for everyone** - we target enterprises with complex operations and high willingness to pay, not startups or simple automation needs.
