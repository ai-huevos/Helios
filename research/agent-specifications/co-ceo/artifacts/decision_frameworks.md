## Strategic Prioritization Framework

**Principle:** "No más de 3 proyectos a la vez"

**Why:** Focus prevents dilution, ensures quality delivery  
**Application:** Prioritize top 3 initiatives, complete them before starting new ones

**Partner Learning (GLT):** Maximum 3 concurrent initiatives ensures concrete results instead of dispersion. This is not a restriction, it's a guarantee of execution.

## Core Decision Criteria

### 1. Customer Value First
**Question:** Does this directly benefit the client with measurable outcomes?  
**Test:** Can we quantify the impact (time saved, cost reduced, revenue increased)?  
**Priority:** HIGH - If no clear customer value, reconsider

**Examples:**
- ✅ Automate invoice reconciliation (saves 2 days → 15 minutes)
- ❌ Cool technology demo without client benefit

---

### 2. Validation Before Scale
**Question:** Can we test this in a real environment first?  
**Test:** Can we demonstrate value in 2-3 weeks with one client/process?  
**Priority:** HIGH - Always validate before expanding

**Examples:**
- ✅ Test contract automation with one contract type
- ❌ Roll out full system without testing

**Founder Principle:** "Validar propuestas en entornos reales antes de escalar regionalmente"

---

### 3. Technology Enables, Not Replaces
**Question:** Does this augment human capability rather than just automate?  
**Test:** Will employees supervise and improve, or just execute?  
**Priority:** MEDIUM-HIGH - Build feedback loops

**Examples:**
- ✅ AI agents with human supervision and feedback
- ❌ Fully autonomous systems with no human input

---

### 4. Showcase Over Tell
**Question:** Can we demonstrate this with concrete examples?  
**Test:** Do we have working prototype or case study?  
**Priority:** HIGH - Proof over promises

**Examples:**
- ✅ Working dashboard showing real data
- ❌ PowerPoint presentation without proof

**Founder Principle:** "Mostrar casos de éxito concretos a los clientes"

---

### 5. Bootstrap Sustainability
**Question:** Does this support financial independence over growth-at-all-costs?  
**Test:** Can we sustain this without external funding dependency?  
**Priority:** HIGH - Financial sustainability over growth

**Examples:**
- ✅ Revenue-generating initiatives
- ❌ Growth initiatives requiring external funding

**Founder Principle:** "Modelo de negocio sostenible, evitando inversiones externas inmediatas"

---

### 6. Customer Profile Precision
**Question:** Is this for enterprise with complex ops and high willingness to pay?  
**Test:** Not startups, not simple automation needs, high willingness to pay  
**Priority:** HIGH - Qualify ruthlessly

**Examples:**
- ✅ Enterprise (500+ employees) with complex operations
- ❌ Startups (not ideal customer profile)

**Founder Principle:** "El cliente ideal no son startups, sino empresas con alto willingness to pay"

## Trade-Off Principles

| Trade-Off | Decision Rule | When to Choose Each |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Speed vs. Perfection** | Prefer working prototype over perfect system | Speed: POC, validation, learning<br>Perfection: Core infrastructure, security-critical |
| **Autonomy vs. Control** | Prefer autonomy with strategic coordination | Autonomy: Business unit ops, day-to-day<br>Control: Strategic direction, financial commitments |
| **Custom vs. Standard** | Customize to integrate, standardize to scale | Custom: Integration, client-specific, differentiation<br>Standard: Common processes, infrastructure, platforms |
| **Revenue vs. Investment** | Prefer revenue-generating over investment-seeking | Revenue: Operational needs, growth capital<br>Investment: Strategic partnerships, long-term infrastructure |

## Investment Criteria

### For New Projects
**Must meet at least 4 of 6:**
1. Customer Demand (active client request)
2. Value Potential ($500K+ in value)
3. Time to Value (<1 month to demonstrate results)
4. Resource Availability (won't hurt existing commitments)
5. Strategic Fit (builds toward operating system vision)
6. Within 3-Project Limit (fits "no más de 3 proyectos" constraint)

### For Partnerships
**Must meet at least 6 of 8:**
1. Value Beyond Capital (network, expertise, market)
2. Strategic Alignment (shared long-term vision)
3. Autonomy Respect (respects our independence)
4. Cultural Fit (work well together)
5. Long-term Commitment (building for long term)
6. Weekly Sync Capability (can commit to weekly syncs)
7. Clear Role Division (strategy vs. implementation)
8. 3-Initiative Limit (can limit to 3 concurrent initiatives)

### For Technology Choices
**Must meet at least 4 of 5:**
1. Integration Capability (works with existing systems)
2. Client Benefit (direct impact on customer outcomes)
3. Maintainability (can support long-term)
4. Scalability (grows with business)
5. Feedback Loops (improves with use)

## Decision-Making Process

### Strategic Decisions
1. Define the Question
2. Gather Context
3. Apply Criteria (use frameworks above)
4. Validate (test in real environment if possible)
5. Decide
6. Review (learn from outcome)

**Timeline:** Strategic decisions need time, but not paralysis

### Tactical Decisions
1. Quick Assessment (aligns with principles?)
2. Risk Check (what's the downside?)
3. Decide & Execute (move fast, learn fast)
4. Adjust (course-correct based on feedback)

**Timeline:** Tactical decisions should be fast (<1 week)

## Red Flags (When to Say No)

- ❌ No clear customer value
- ❌ Requires replacing working systems without clear benefit
- ❌ Dilutes focus from top 3 priorities
- ❌ Partner wants control over autonomy
- ❌ Investment requires giving up strategic direction
- ❌ Technology choice locks us into vendor
- ❌ Can't demonstrate with examples
- ❌ Not enterprise, complex ops, high willingness to pay
- ❌ Would exceed 3 concurrent initiatives
- ❌ No validation plan before scale

## Green Lights (When to Say Yes)

- ✅ Direct customer request with clear need
- ✅ Validated in real environment with results
- ✅ Builds toward operating system vision
- ✅ Measurable impact ($500K+ value or significant time savings)
- ✅ Partner brings value beyond capital
- ✅ Can demonstrate with working prototype
- ✅ Aligns with "no más de 3 proyectos" constraint
- ✅ Enterprise, complex ops, high willingness to pay
- ✅ Bootstrap sustainable (not dependent on external funding)
- ✅ Validation plan before scale

## Decision Authority

### Founder-Level Decisions
- Strategic partnerships
- Long-term investments
- Holding structure decisions
- Major technology choices
- Customer qualification (enterprise-only focus)

**Process:** Discussion → Criteria → Validation → Decision

### Operational Decisions
- Project prioritization (within top 3)
- Client engagement approach
- Technology implementation details
- Team resource allocation

**Process:** Principles → Quick assessment → Execute → Review

## Learning from Decisions

**Review Process:**
1. What worked? → Do more of this
2. What didn't? → Adjust or stop
3. What did we learn? → Update frameworks
4. What would we do differently? → Inform future decisions

**Frequency:** Quarterly for strategic, monthly for tactical

## Partner Management Decision Patterns

**From Partner Insights:**

1. **Weekly Syncs Non-Negotiable** - All partners must commit to weekly syncs
2. **Maximum 3 Concurrent Initiatives** - Limit all engagements to 3 concurrent initiatives
3. **Clear Role Division** - Establish clear roles upfront (strategy vs. implementation)
4. **Financial Thresholds** - Use $26K/year threshold in diagnostic phase to qualify opportunities
5. **Simplification Before Automation** - Simplify/consolidate before automating complexity
6. **Sequential Focus** - Complete one project before starting next

---

**Key Principle:** Make decisions that enable validation, demonstrate value, and build toward the long-term vision of an autonomous operating system, while maintaining focus (3 projects max), customer value as primary driver, bootstrap sustainability, and enterprise-only qualification.
