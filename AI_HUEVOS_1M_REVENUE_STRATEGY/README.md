## 🧪 CORE MARKET HYPOTHESES TO TEST

### Hypothesis #1: "Revenue Systems Engineering" Category Positioning
**Problem**: Technical founders have great products but broken revenue systems
**Solution**: AI-powered revenue systems that work 24/7, not marketing campaigns
**Test**: LinkedIn positioning change + outreach response rates
**Success Metric**: 40%+ improvement in qualified meeting conversion

### Hypothesis #2: Immediate Value Through Existing Knowledge Base
**Problem**: Companies need instant ROI, not 6-month implementations
**Solution**: Deploy existing playbooks/assessments as immediate revenue products
**Test**: Package existing assets as $2K-$15K diagnostic/implementation products
**Success Metric**: 50%+ faster sales cycles vs. current consulting approach

### Hypothesis #3: Performance-Based Pricing Accelerates Deals
**Problem**: Q4 budget urgency + risk aversion requires different pricing models
**Solution**: $5K base + 20% of measurable outcomes
**Test**: Traditional consulting vs. performance-based proposals
**Success Metric**: 60%+ faster decision cycles + higher deal values

### Hypothesis #4: AI-First Delivery Creates Competitive Moat
**Problem**: Human-dependent consulting doesn't scale
**Solution**: AI agents handle 80% of delivery, humans focus on strategy
**Test**: Deploy AI agents for client monitoring/reporting
**Success Metric**: 3x client capacity without proportional staff increase
